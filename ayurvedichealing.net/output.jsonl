In Ayurveda, spring marks the beginning of allergy season. With new pollen in the air, colds and excess mucus are common as the warmer temperature melts the accumulated kapha dosha. For many, this can mean a time of headaches, sneezing, stuffy nose, scratchy throat and fatigue. These symptoms are often only abated temporarily by powerful antihistamines and decongestants that may have side effects more uncomfortable than the original symptoms. Whether you have seasonal or chronic allergies to airborne irritants, foods, chemicals, plants, or animals – it’s important to not only learn how to deal with your symptoms, but most importantly, how to eliminate the root cause.\nDuring spring, your body has to work to shed the excess of winter and balance the amount of fire and water in your system. Too much water combined with excess earth can leave you feeling heavy, muggy and full of toxins (ama). Too much fire and you may experience feeling angry, overheated, overworked, full of allergies and without enough time. And too much fire and water combined may leave you feeling taxed, inflamed and pressurized (think sinus headache).

In Ayurveda, spring marks the beginning of allergy season. With new pollen in the air, colds and excess mucus are common as the warmer temperature melts the accumulated kapha dosha. For many, this can mean a time of headaches, sneezing, stuffy nose, scratchy throat and fatigue. These symptoms are often only abated temporarily by powerful antihistamines and decongestants that may have side effects more uncomfortable than the original symptoms. Whether you have seasonal or chronic allergies to airborne irritants, foods, chemicals, plants, or animals – it’s important to not only learn how to deal with your symptoms, but most importantly, how to eliminate the root cause.\nDuring spring, your body has to work to shed the excess of winter and balance the amount of fire and water in your system. Too much water combined with excess earth can leave you feeling heavy, muggy and full of toxins (ama). Too much fire and you may experience feeling angry, overheated, overworked, full of allergies and without enough time. And too much fire and water combined may leave you feeling taxed, inflamed and pressurized (think sinus headache). Since spring is ruled by the organs of liver and gallbladder, our main organs for cleansing and processing toxins, it’s important to take extra care during this time. Your liver processes allergens that come from pollen and pollution, but if the liver is taxed, it has a hard time working as smoothly.\nAyurvedic Herbal Formulas\nHere are a fewHerbal Formulationsdesigned specifically to help you feel your best during spring:", "content_info": {"domain": "daily_life", "subdomain": "Health tips and personal care"}}}}

Skin is the matrix and fabric of the human body, which acts as a barometer for an individual’s health. When you are happy and healthy, when you feel good about yourself — that feeling shows on your outer body, and your skin glows.\nThe Skin as a Digestive Organ\nHave you ever wondered what happens to everything you put on your skin? Believe it or not, in a way it is actually “eaten.”\nOur skin is both like a sponge and a stomach. It soaks up and digests everything that we apply topically, so we have to be very careful with what we put on our skin. Be aware of skin and body care products that say “for external application only” –  because there is no such thing! Foods, lotions and emotions all enter the blood stream and affect our physiology.\nUnfortunately, we are surrounded by a toxic environment. Through food, air and water, we ingest knowingly or unknowingly, toxins which accumulate, making our body and mind very sluggish. Our immune system becomes vulnerable and this is the very beginning stage of many imbalances. Through these imbalances, symptoms arise and create a host of issues including digestive disturbances, congestion, weakness, inflammation, joint pain and skin problems.\nThe Truth About Cosmetics\nYou probably have assumed that the ingredients in your skin care products are safe, right? After all, why would they be on the shelves if they weren’t? Well, the alarming truth is that according to the Environmental Working Group, the FDA has not evaluated the safety of 90% of the cosmetic ingredients, nor has any other organization devoted to public health! In Europe on the other hand, 1,110 personal care products have beenbanned from the marketdue to concerns about the nature of their side effects. Sadly, in the United States,only 10of these chemicals have been prohibited.\nSo if you want your skin to be healthy and radiant, you need to make sure that you use only natural ingredients on your skin and detoxify from time to time.\nThe Ayurvedic Perspective\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, we have identified a force of nature that is responsible for processing what our skin comes into contact with. ThePitta dosha(specifically thesub-dosha called bhrajaka Pitta), is responsible for digestion, metabolism, transformation and giving color to your skin. If this process is functioning properly, then the skin will absorb all that is beneficial and eliminate the rest. If it is not working well, our pours become blocked with impurities and our skin isn’t able to breathe. Our skin, has a tremendous power to restore, repair and replenish itself. Skin is the body’s first defensive organ against external elements.\nThe skin also serves as a detoxification pathway. There are three main ways that the body detoxifies: (1) Through urine, (2) feces, and (3) sweat. Out of all of these waste-excreting organs, the skin is the largest. Problems like acne, rashes or eczema occur when the skin is attempting to expel metabolic toxins from the blood.\nHealthy Liver = Healthy Skin\nThe liver is the organ that detoxifies all of our blood. It cleansesallthat we take in through each and every one of our senses. It is responsible for keeping what is needed to nourish the body and for breaking down anything that is not. When unneeded substances are properly broken down, they can be eliminated more easily. If the liver is bogged down by poor diet, cigarettes, alcohol, prescription drugs, synthetic hormones, or even the chemicals in your skin care products – it isn’t able to do its job as well. When there is too much of a burden on the liver, then toxins accumulate and impurities begin to circulate through the blood.\nExcess toxic load (↑) Liver Function (↓) Toxins in Blood (↑) = Skin Problems\nIf the liver is strong and the blood is clean and free of toxins, then the skin will shine with luster and a healthy glow. If the liver has a full toxic load, then impurities in the blood will accumulate, and wastes will be carried to the skin where they will be forced to exit the body in the form of acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, warts and rashes depending on various factors.\nWe see many skin problems during the spring and summer because pitta starts to accumulate and aggravate.\nThe Importance of Seasonal Detoxification\nAccording to Ayurveda, we need to detoxify our body, mind and emotions during these transition periods. Emotional health also plays an important role in keeping your skin healthy. There is a definite relationship between your brain and skin. If you are upset, that shows up on your skin in the form of a rash, acne, psoriasis or eczema. On other hand, if you are happy that gives a nice glow to your skin.\nWhen you do a spring cleanse and receive some Ayurvedic treatments likeAbhyanga –warm herbal oil massage,lymphatic massage, exfoliating scrubs, dry brush massage, sauna and steam bath,this stimulates the lymphatic system and circulation.  These treatments improve lymphatic drainage, boost immunity and remove dead skin cells. Herbal steam dilates the blood vessels and opens channels so that impurities can easily move out. Herbal sweating opens our pores and allows our skin to release any toxins that may have accumulated, either from faulty digestive capacity ofPittain the skin or an over exposure to harmful substances. Additionally, these warming treatments relax the muscles and relieve stiffness and re-hydrate dry skin.\nIn addition, oil enemas are helpful in calming down the nervous system, emotions and alleviating dry skin.\nSimple Tips for Radiant skin:\nDrink hot water with lemon.\nDrink hot water with lemon.\nDrink herbalPitta Tea,Lymph TeaorDetox Tea–this will allow you to sweat the toxins out of your body.
