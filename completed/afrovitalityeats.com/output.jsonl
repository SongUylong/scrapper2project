{"ID": "2beb215e636b6c16b7ad567c16e21073", "Text": "ACCRA BANANA\nAccra banana is a delightful gluten free fritter that has been a favorite since childhood. Crunchy on the outside, soft and sweet inside. A popular street food in Cameroon that filled my childhood belly on my walk to school most days. Five to six of these fritters wrapped in a piece of brown paper with a scoop of hot pepper sauce and served with bouille was a popular breakfast. Today, it is one of our most loved appetizer and finger food to serve at parties.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Accra-banana.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nINGREDIENTS FOR ACCRA BANANA\nCassava : Cassava also known as Yuca, Manioc or Tapioca is a starchy, gluten free root vegetable that is grown in many countries across Africa. In Cameroon cooking, this single root has been processed to make things like gari, waterfufu, cassava flour and in the world of boxed goods in the diaspora, pancake and cookie mixes. You can find cassava in your local African, Asian or Mexican markets. I have also spotted some frozen cassava in the freezer section at publix\nRipe Banana : The extra ripe bananas we use makes accra beans naturally sweet. You do not need any sugar added. It also gives them that soft sweet center following the crispy bite and the beautiful golden brown color.\nCornmeal : Though not a main ingredient, cornmeal holds everything together, providing an airier texture with a nice crispy bite.\nPEPARING THE CASSAVA FOR ACCRA BANANA\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cassava-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nThough it might seem intimidating like its other friend the green plantains, Cassava is actually quite easy to work with. You'll want to start by peeling off the tough skin. The tubers can be up to a foot long if not more. On a sturdy board, start by chopping off the tapered ends. Then cut root into two-inch cylinders. You can firmly grab one of these with your dominant hand or place on the chopping board and make a slit through the tough skin until you reach the white flesh. Then using a paring knife, carefully lift the skin, which will peel off as a ring. Place peeled cassava into a bowl of water to prevent it from turning brown. Cut into small chunks and blend with a little water until just smooth. You want a little texture so do not pulverize the cassava.\nTransfer this to a cheese cloth and squeeze as much water as you can to obtain a thick paste.\nMAKING THE ACCRA MIXTURE\nHere is one of those situations where you really have to see, feel and touch to get the right consistency. Once you get your thick cassava paste, you mix this with smashed ripe bananas. Then we are going to add enough cornmeal, so the mixture is just firm enough to hold a shape. Too soft and it disintegrates when you fry and too hard, you miss on that pillowy soft bite. Season with salt. This gives the perfect balance of sweet and savory.\nFRYING THE FRITTERS\nFry these in preferred cooking oil for about 5 minutes or until a dark golden brown and center is opaque and not white. Smaller sizes cook a little quicker and more evenly. So, your scoops should be small. Oil temperature should also not be too high because they will brown quicker and not cook through the center. Ideal temp should be no more than 350 degrees Fahrenheit and at least. 330 degrees F. You want an immediate sizzle once you drop them in.\nOnce fried, set them on a paper towel to soak up the excess oil. If you're like me, you'll be tempted to dig in right away but let it cool for a couple of minutes to avoid burns. Now enjoy a crispy bite! That perfect balance of sweet and savory. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce or keep it traditional with a side of red pepper sauce.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Accra-banana-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nACCRA BANANA\nA crispy sweet and savory fritter\nPrep Time: 20 minutes mins, Cook Time: 5 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 large cassava tuber\n- 3-4 ripe bananas\n- 1/4 cup plus 4-6 Tbsp fine Corn meal\n- 1 tsp salt\n- Oil for frying\nInstructions\n1.

Add this into bowl with cassava, salt and mix well.\n4. Add in cornmeal and stir until just combine. Adjust amount as needed. You should be able to scoop or form a soft dough that can hold a shape in your hand or spoon.\n5. Heat oil in a fry pan up to 330-350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n6. Using a spoon, scoop out small bite sized amounts of dough and fry until golden brown. This should take about 5- 7 minutes.\n7. Remove from oil and transfer unto a paper towel. Let cool to touch and enjoy with pepper sauce or your favorite dip.\nNotes\nIf using frozen yuca, thaw before blending. Banana should be very ripe, with black spots. It should be easily smashed.

Thank me later, after your family or friends clean up their plates and ask for seconds.\nThis Peanut Soup with tofu is definitely a must try in my honest and humble opinion. With time from prep to eating under 45 minutes, you can get dinner on the table in record time. Not only is it delicious, its also healthy and super easy to make. Regardless of your dietary preference you have options. This recipe is strictly vegan but it works great with fried fish, beef, chicken and so much more. I did cut a few corners but eh, why not go the easy route especially if it doesn't take away from the flavor. Typically you'll find me roasting raw peanuts but I picked up some dry roasted (Unsalted ) peanuts from Walgreens for this one. I still enjoy the smell from pan roasting peanuts, it brings back those childhood memories. Here's how you can roast peanuts at home for eating or for use with this recipe\nUsed extra firm tofu for protein. The secret with tofu? Do not shy away from seasonings. Unless you literally dump a handful of salt on it, its hard to over season. Getting it crispy involves getting rid of as much water as you can. Slice the tofu block down the middle, wrap it up in a kitchen towel and dry with some weights.\nNOW WE SEASON!!!!\nI definitely didn't shy away from my spices.

Avocados are even better, especially if you are on a sugar restriction. The mango comes in for the sweetness, but a pinch of stevia is also added. With a smoothie like this you can definitely add to it and make it your own. Chia seeds are a great addition to my green smoothies.

So here we are, with 3 avocados that are ready to eat and another really close to the mark too. What to do? You can always make guac! Avocado toast. Or this amazing smoothie.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Green-smoothie.jpg?resize=1280%2C1920&ssl=1]\nUsually I use bananas , not only as a sweetening agent in my smoothies but also to get a nice creamy consistency. Avocados are even better, especially if you are on a sugar restriction. The mango comes in for the sweetness, but a pinch of stevia is also added. With a smoothie like this you can definitely add to it and make it your own. Chia seeds are a great addition to my green smoothies. Sometimes I'll throw in some wheat grass for that earthy flavor.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Green-Spinach-smoothie.jpg?resize=1276%2C1914&ssl=1]\nMaking smoothies in the morning is a quick trick to not skipping breakfast.

We love the simplicity of this meal and how effortlessly it comes to be. The mild flavor of the black bass, pairs wonderfully with the sweet flavor of caramelized fennel. It was honestly enjoyed as is but you are welcome to bring in some roasted veggies or fries.\nINGREDIENTS FOR BAKED WHOLE BLACK BASS\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Baked-bass-ingredients-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nBlack Bass has a delicate and mild flavor. So even non fish lovers tend to like that about it. It has a firmer texture than tilapia and less fatty than salmon or mackerel. Buying whole fish could be intimidating but there are a few things to consider. First things first; your source. Even if you can't find the original source, it is safe to say you should be buying from a reputable distributor. Once that is cleared, we need to look at the whole fish. The smell should be a telltale sign of freshness. If it smells funky, walk away! Eyes should be firm and not sunken. The gills should be bright red, skin should be shiny and also firm when you press on the flesh.\nFennel was introduced to me by a local farmer. It has a whitish green bulb with feather like green fronds. It is a cool weather crop so if you've never had it , this is the time to try this wonderful vegetable. The whole plant is edible and here we are caramelizing the bulb. To caramelize, we slice the bulb like an onion. Trim off a little bit of the root end, cut just above the bulb then peel the outer layer. Slice fennel lengthwise and remove tough core. Then thinly slice fennel and cook until golden brown. This adds a little sweetness to the dish. We also used some of the fennel stalk as a bed on which our fish was baked. This adds another layer of flavor to the fish.\nKeeping this super simple and definitely not lacking in flavor, we are adding just garlic and parsley for aromatics. Feel free to bring in some more herbs especially if you have some growing in the backyard. Herbs to consider are rosemary, tarragon, basil or oregano. Gather what you have, it's hard to go wrong with fresh herbs. Chop parsley and garlic, add some avocado or olive oil and use to marinate your fish. This simple pair does wonders, especially with a fish like black bass.\nMARINATING THE FISH\nThoroughly clean fish, removing scales and gills ( Save time and ask your vendor if they can do the cleaning for you). Make about 1/4 inch deep slits on both sides of the fish. Then season with salt and black pepper. Generously rub fish with garlic herb marinade, making sure the gut and slits are stuffed. Add two slices of lemon into the gut of the fish. Then preheat your oven for baking. You can also try our cilantro lime marinade here .\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/black-bass-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/black-bass.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nBAKING A WHOLE FISH\nSince we're not firing up the outdoor grill in the middle of winter, the convection oven works great too.

We love the simplicity of this meal and how effortlessly it comes to be. The mild flavor of the black bass, pairs wonderfully with the sweet flavor of caramelized fennel.

So even non fish lovers tend to like that about it. It has a firmer texture than tilapia and less fatty than salmon or mackerel. Buying whole fish could be intimidating but there are a few things to consider. First things first; your source. Even if you can't find the original source, it is safe to say you should be buying from a reputable distributor. Once that is cleared, we need to look at the whole fish. The smell should be a telltale sign of freshness. If it smells funky, walk away! Eyes should be firm and not sunken. The gills should be bright red, skin should be shiny and also firm when you press on the flesh.\nFennel was introduced to me by a local farmer. It has a whitish green bulb with feather like green fronds. It is a cool weather crop so if you've never had it , this is the time to try this wonderful vegetable.

The summer may be coming to an end, but that does not have to be the case with your basil. Here we will explore how you can enjoy fresh basil all year round as that really is the best way to have basil. And if you are so inclined, how to have your own plant that keeps on giving.\nGROWING BASIL\nThis is one of the easiest herbs to grow, both outdoors and on your windowsill indoors. If you're so inclined to start from seeds, follow your hardiness zone and decide when to start indoors. Typically, you'll need at least 4- 8 weeks before transplanting. Once you're ready to transplant, don't forget to harden them off. Remember, you'll be going from maybe kitchen window to new environment. Or you can just easily purchase an organic plant from a local nursery or grocery.\nMost insects will stay clear of basil plant except this year we noticed some Japanese beetles feasting on our basil plants. We hand pick them and you can also set out a trap. We avoid any sprays especially when it comes to culinary herbs. Basil needs sun, lots of it. They need at least 6-8 hours of sun light. Keep the soil moist. Setting up a watering system like a snip-n-drip on a timer could be useful.\nBUYING BASIL\nWhen buying , ensure the leaves are vibrant ( green or purple) with no dark spots and show no signs of wilting. Look for organically grown plants as some growers may use herbicides.\nHOW TO STORE\nStore for up to 10 days in a jar of water on the countertop. You might see some roots sprouting. This root can be transplanted to a pot outdoor. It will be a nice gift idea. Refrigerating will cause it to darken and loose its vibrant color. That is why you will not find basil in the refrigerated section at your local grocery store.\nYou can also blanch and freeze for up to 6 months. Blanching helps maintain that rich vibrant color.\nBlend into a paste, add some olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays. These cubes can last up to a year if stored properly in an airtight container. Topping off with olive oil prevents it from oxidizing. These cubes are great in soups, stews, sauces and more.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/make-pesto.jpg?resize=1009%2C1513&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/basil.jpg?resize=1148%2C1722&ssl=1]\nAnd let's not forget the pesto. Another great way store all that fresh basil. Make a big batch which can easily be frozen for future use. You can store in the fridge for up to a week or freeze in ice cube trays topped with olive oil.\nBasil gets much love for a reason. This fragrant herb comes in different varieties and its culinary impact spans the globe. You'll find me adding a few leaves into Cameroonian staples like this Mushroom Pepper Soup or spreading a spoonful of pesto over some focaccia.

This root can be transplanted to a pot outdoor. It will be a nice gift idea. Refrigerating will cause it to darken and loose its vibrant color. That is why you will not find basil in the refrigerated section at your local grocery store.\nYou can also blanch and freeze for up to 6 months. Blanching helps maintain that rich vibrant color.\nBlend into a paste, add some olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays. These cubes can last up to a year if stored properly in an airtight container. Topping off with olive oil prevents it from oxidizing. These cubes are great in soups, stews, sauces and more.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/make-pesto.jpg?resize=1009%2C1513&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/basil.jpg?resize=1148%2C1722&ssl=1]\nAnd let's not forget the pesto. Another great way store all that fresh basil. Make a big batch which can easily be frozen for future use. You can store in the fridge for up to a week or freeze in ice cube trays topped with olive oil.\nBasil gets much love for a reason. This fragrant herb comes in different varieties and its culinary impact spans the globe. You'll find me adding a few leaves into Cameroonian staples like this Mushroom Pepper Soup or spreading a spoonful of pesto over some focaccia. Hope you'll be making your basil last a lot longer with these tips.", "content_info": {"domain": "daily_life", "subdomain": "Cooking Tips, food knowledge, food preservation"}}}}

With its nitrate content, some studies show increased endurance. Just another reason we are loving its presence.\n- PINEAPPLE : One of our favorite energy boosting tropical fruit. A rich source of Vitamin C, A, beta- carotene and other B vitamins. Its sweet and tangy taste negates the need for any extra sweetener and works in tandem with the lemon for that perfectly balanced shot.\n- LEMON : There is always room for some citrus love with our immunity shots. They complement the sweetness from the beets and pineapple.\n- PARSLEY : When the backyard herbs are still thriving, why not throw some in there. Herbs are so nutrient dense it's shocking they are not always a constant in immunity shots. We are bring in an earthy spin to this beet immunity drink with our use of some fresh sprigs of Parsley.\n- G INGER: We call this a friend to our gut.

We love the slight bite it brings to these shots.\nPREPARING YOUR INGREDIENTS\nGather all your ingredients and give them a thorough wash.

Black eyed peas are enjoyed through out Africa in a vast variety of traditional dishes. Lets start with me, Lebialem Cameroon. The traditional dish, country chop like we say is Koki beans and plantains. We soak the beans overnight and the next day peel off the skin. We then blend into a smooth paste, mix with some palm oil, other seasonings and then cook in plantain leaves. This yields a delicious pudding which is usually served with plantains or cocoyams.\nAkara beans or black eyed peas fritters like some call it is another way we work with black eyed peas. Peel, blend, season, pan fry or deep fry. This is a common street food in Cameroon and some other West African countries. Enjoy as is or with a side of fiery hot pepper sauce. So much flavor! Moin moin is very popular in Nigeria mostly but also in Cameroon. The beans are blended with peppers, seasoned and cooked in plantain leaves or baked in a casserole dish. Red red, is a spicy black eyed peas stew enjoyed in Ghana. Palm oil, Tomatoes, chili peppers, onions are some of the spices that all work to produce a must try stew if you have not done so already.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_3800.jpg?resize=1280%2C1280&ssl=1]\nBLACK EYED PEAS SALAD\nToday is something different, different from what I'm accustom to when it comes to this bean. This hearty salad can pass for appetizer, main course, lunch or dinner. It's clean, simple, super easy to make and just darn right delicious. Be sure to soak your beans overnight, so at least 8 hours. It cooks in about 20 minutes, especially for a salad like this. You want a bite to it. I for one don't mess with raw red onions unless i'm dealing with salsas. Here is another exception for me. The red onions, cilantro, pepper, cumin and more make this bowl one flavorful power house.

Black eyed peas are enjoyed through out Africa in a vast variety of traditional dishes. Lets start with me, Lebialem Cameroon. The traditional dish, country chop like we say is Koki beans and plantains. We soak the beans overnight and the next day peel off the skin. We then blend into a smooth paste, mix with some palm oil, other seasonings and then cook in plantain leaves. This yields a delicious pudding which is usually served with plantains or cocoyams.\nAkara beans or black eyed peas fritters like some call it is another way we work with black eyed peas. Peel, blend, season, pan fry or deep fry. This is a common street food in Cameroon and some other West African countries. Enjoy as is or with a side of fiery hot pepper sauce. So much flavor! Moin moin is very popular in Nigeria mostly but also in Cameroon. The beans are blended with peppers, seasoned and cooked in plantain leaves or baked in a casserole dish. Red red, is a spicy black eyed peas stew enjoyed in Ghana. Palm oil, Tomatoes, chili peppers, onions are some of the spices that all work to produce a must try stew if you have not done so already.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_3800.jpg?resize=1280%2C1280&ssl=1]\nBLACK EYED PEAS SALAD\nToday is something different, different from what I'm accustom to when it comes to this bean. This hearty salad can pass for appetizer, main course, lunch or dinner. It's clean, simple, super easy to make and just darn right delicious. Be sure to soak your beans overnight, so at least 8 hours. It cooks in about 20 minutes, especially for a salad like this. You want a bite to it. I for one don't mess with raw red onions unless i'm dealing with salsas. Here is another exception for me. The red onions, cilantro, pepper, cumin and more make this bowl one flavorful power house.

The coarse, the large chunk and the creamy delight. It is very tempting to stop at the second stage; wondering what in the world to do with the large chunk of grainy peanuts. Do not add any liquid or oil to ease blending, let it do its thing. After a short while, you'll notice the chunk loosening up. Let it go until it is almost runny. The natural oils from the peanuts are helping out. That is why we always question why some brands add palm oil to their peanut butter?\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cacao-peanut-butter-spread-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nOnce it is well blended, add your cacao powder.

That is why we always question why some brands add palm oil to their peanut butter?\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cacao-peanut-butter-spread-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nOnce it is well blended, add your cacao powder. Cacao unlike Cocoa powder is a little more bitter. Bringing in some raw honey really helps balance the taste resulting to this creamy, lightly sweetened delight. So think about the bitterness when deciding on how much cacao powder to add. The more you add, the more honey you'll need.\nQUICK NOTE ON CACAO VS COCOA POWDER\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peanut-butter-sppon.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWe sure do hope you enjoy making a batch of this cacao peanut butter spread for your in home use.

Baylee with her new found ability to crawl is trying to get into anything and everything. My mom is giving detailed instructions and I am paying close attention.\nWhen some people say recipes are passed down, its very easy to assume it is written down and handed to you. Growing up I simply learn by being there in the kitchen, keeping a close eye on whatever goes into the pot. And no, I wasn't sitting there with a piece of paper asking my mother how many cups of water she adds to her stew. Or how many fresh tomatoes, bunches of spinach, sprigs of parsley goes with it. You are there throughout preparation of the meal, passing the salt and other condiments when asked to.\nTaste as you go she says! That's exactly what you should do with this dish. Lots of pictures to show the steps but this is one of those dishes that require more than just reading a recipe.\nThe BEANS FOR KOKI BEANS\nBlack eyed peas. If you buy these from an African store, the label will read koki beans. They should be peeled! Please do yourself a favor, pay the extra bucks and get peeled beans. The process of peeling the skin off these beans will add an extra 4-5 hours if you are not familiar with the technique. So tedious it might make you not want to try this. so lets not do that. It really is one to enjoy. Soak beans for at least 3 hours or overnight if possible. Blend with some water until creamy. Feel free to add a scotch bonnet pepper or two for some heat.\nAt this point, my mom usually brings out the mortar and pestle. She pours this batter into the mortar, grips the bottom firmly with her feet and stirs rapidly. She'll ask me to jump in and keep going while she preps the wrapping station. Two minutes later you might feel like your arms are about to fall off! That's when she tells my sister to take over. This makes it fluffy. I know what you're thinking....Hand Mixer!!!! And yes! Here, I will use that, but back home, its the mortar and pestle.\nThen we season\nWhen they say season to taste, take it literally here. We taste the batter , even though uncooked. I'm not saying taste a spoonful. It wont kill you but it probably will not be very palatable. Some salt and maggi to taste. If its not spicy enough you can add some powdered pepper.\nPalm oil gives it that rich color. You can use more or less if you want but some is essential for the flavor. Cook until it just starts to smoke. You want to maintain that dark red color. If you cook for too long it starts to loose its color.\nAdd into the mixture and stir until well incorporated. It helps that the oil is warm. Room temperature or cold palm oil will be much more difficult to work with here.\nStir in some warm water, half a cup at a time until your batter runs as shown. Almost waffle batter. If its too thick, your end product will be a little too firm. Likewise if your batter is too runny, you might end up with a mushy mess. Warm water because you don't want any oil water separation to occur.\nStill looking for coco yam leaves but chopped spinach will do just fine. This gives it some color and adds a different dimension to the dish. \"Ankura\" is the last bundle tied. This contains more coco yam leaves and traditionally reserved for my father or grandfather.\nYou can taste and adjust seasoning again before wrapping.\nBanana leaves! It took me 10 years to find banana leaves in America!Not a big deal for some but it sure is for me. There is a significant difference between wrapping koki beans in foil versus banana leaves. That being said, you can still enjoy this dish without banana leaves. The joy on our faces when my sister and I discovered banana leaves at a local Mexican store. We grabbed so many bundles you'll think its a zombie apocalypse and we needed the leaves for shelter!\nMy mother will harvest large plantain leaves the day she needs them. She removes the thick stalk and then warms the leaves over open flame. This prevents the leaves from tearing during wrapping. The leaves are large enough to wrap without using foil. We use foil in this case to prevent leaks because the leaves are smaller. With the store bought leaves, warm over open flame or steep in very hot water for about 15 minutes.\nWrapping koki beans might seam challenging but trust me its super easy, especially if you are using foil too. You want the batter in direct contact the banana leaves. Not only does this impact a whole new depth of flavor, it makes it a lot easier to peel when ready. Line a large bowl with foil paper. Push down so it almost takes the shape of the bowl. Then add in the banana leaves. Double layers if necessary to avoid any leaks. Add about a cup and a half of the bean batter, carefully pull the sides of the leaves in. Follow with the foil and tightly seal.\nVoila! Its all done.

{"ID": "d6dc27f4384fc6c7b066bf55ebab9faa", "Text": "Spicy Cameroon Njangsa Sauce with Trout and ripe plantains\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/African-Njangsa-Soup.png?resize=800%2C1200&ssl=1]\nAnother ethnic dish from Cameroon. When people ask me about home I can't wait to jump right in with the story telling. You mean home as in where I grew up or home as in my village? Where my grandma resides? They are as different as day and night, and that's the beauty of home for me.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/African-Njansa-sauce-with-fish.jpg?resize=2511%2C2077&ssl=1]\nWell , home for this dish is my village, Lebialem Sub division, Bechati/ Folepi in Cameroon. Growing up in the city we rarely visited the village. During those holidays our parents decided it was time to pay the grandparents a visit, these \"city kids\" knew they were in for a treat. All meals prepped and I didn't even have to do dishes? Count me in. Waking up to just \"Conversations\", No city noise, no cars honking; just greeting in our dialect. Children running around, men and women returning home from hunting/ farming. Life was simple and peaceful. You can tell I miss home, that's the inspiration behind this dish today. One of my favorites from grandma. Back then the fish came from the river literally a stone throw from our house, plantains from the farm. Unfortunately due to overfishing , today, they source fish from outside vendors on special market days only. Regardless, this recipe lives on.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Njangsang-sauce-ingredients.jpg?resize=3648%2C2432&ssl=1]\nOne can never exactly replicate grandma's recipe, even my mother's country fish will never taste as good as my grandma's ( No offense ma). It's a fact that cannot be argued. In fact, random story. My husband casually said \" Your mom's koki beans tastes better\"in front of the whole family during our Christmas meal a year back. Lol, of course! But since you enjoyed her's so much you had to call me out, when next you want koki beans, do catch a flight to Canada love!\nSo back to this recipe, It calls for some ingredients you can only find at an African grocery store; Cameroonian grocery store to be specific. With the many tribes and different traditions in Cameroon I can't guarantee your local Cameroonian restaurant will have this dish, but you might know someone , who knows someone that can let you sample this dish. It's one uniquely African dish that will probably make you ask all the questions I 'd love to answer and of course go for seconds!\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Njangsang-Sauce-with-fish.jpg?resize=3081%2C2432&ssl=1]\nI used trout but you can try any white fish. Its been prepared with salmon before but white fish works better and really soaks up the flavor from all the spices as it cooks. Also prefer whole fish, bones and all but you are more than welcome to use fillets.\nCameroon Njangsa Sauce\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Djangsa-sauce.jpg?resize=3467%2C2275&ssl=1]\nSPICY NJANGSA SAUCE WITH TROUT AND RIPE PLANTAINS\nPrep Time: 10 minutes mins, Cook Time: 30 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 pound Whole rainbow Trout (Cleaned descaled and cut into four pieces)\n- 1/4 cup Njangsa\n- 1/2 Tbsp Country Onions\n- 1/4 tsp mbongo spice\n- 1/2 medium Onions (1/4 sliced and 1/4 to be blended)\n- 1 small roma tomatoe\n- 1 clove garlic\n- 1 sprig Parsley\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n- 1/2 cup water\n- salt to taste\n- Scallions for garnish\n- 1 medium Habanero pepper\nInstructions\n1. Descale fish, thoroughly rinse and cut as shown. Transfer to a medium sauce pan.\n2. Blend Njangsa, parsley, garlic, habanero, tomaotoe, onions with 1/2 cup of water until smooth and creamy.\n3. Add to sauce pan. Then add country onions, mbongo spice, salt to taste. Turn heat to medium and simmer for about 20-25 minutes while stirring occasionally. Add more water if too thick.\n4. Meanwhile, in a small fry pan, heat vegetable oil and fry remaining onions until it starts to brown. Transfer into sauce pan with fish and cook for another 5-7 minutes.\n5. Serve with plantains ( Or Rice, African Yams, Coco yams and more)\nNotes\nPlantains Semi ripe plantains will cook quicker than green plantains. Depending on how ripe they are, you can cook for as little as 20 minutes. Wash and peel plantains before cooking so they are nice and soft.

When people ask me about home I can't wait to jump right in with the story telling. You mean home as in where I grew up or home as in my village? Where my grandma resides? They are as different as day and night, and that's the beauty of home for me.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/African-Njansa-sauce-with-fish.jpg?resize=2511%2C2077&ssl=1]\nWell , home for this dish is my village, Lebialem Sub division, Bechati/ Folepi in Cameroon. Growing up in the city we rarely visited the village. During those holidays our parents decided it was time to pay the grandparents a visit, these \"city kids\" knew they were in for a treat. All meals prepped and I didn't even have to do dishes? Count me in. Waking up to just \"Conversations\", No city noise, no cars honking; just greeting in our dialect. Children running around, men and women returning home from hunting/ farming. Life was simple and peaceful. You can tell I miss home, that's the inspiration behind this dish today. One of my favorites from grandma. Back then the fish came from the river literally a stone throw from our house, plantains from the farm. Unfortunately due to overfishing , today, they source fish from outside vendors on special market days only. Regardless, this recipe lives on.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Njangsang-sauce-ingredients.jpg?resize=3648%2C2432&ssl=1]\nOne can never exactly replicate grandma's recipe, even my mother's country fish will never taste as good as my grandma's ( No offense ma). It's a fact that cannot be argued. In fact, random story. My husband casually said \" Your mom's koki beans tastes better\"in front of the whole family during our Christmas meal a year back. Lol, of course! But since you enjoyed her's so much you had to call me out, when next you want koki beans, do catch a flight to Canada love!\nSo back to this recipe, It calls for some ingredients you can only find at an African grocery store; Cameroonian grocery store to be specific. With the many tribes and different traditions in Cameroon I can't guarantee your local Cameroonian restaurant will have this dish, but you might know someone , who knows someone that can let you sample this dish. It's one uniquely African dish that will probably make you ask all the questions I 'd love to answer and of course go for seconds!\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Njangsang-Sauce-with-fish.jpg?resize=3081%2C2432&ssl=1]\nI used trout but you can try any white fish. Its been prepared with salmon before but white fish works better and really soaks up the flavor from all the spices as it cooks. Also prefer whole fish, bones and all but you are more than welcome to use fillets.\nCameroon Njangsa Sauce\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Djangsa-sauce.jpg?resize=3467%2C2275&ssl=1]\nSPICY NJANGSA SAUCE WITH TROUT AND RIPE PLANTAINS\nPrep Time: 10 minutes mins, Cook Time: 30 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 pound Whole rainbow Trout (Cleaned descaled and cut into four pieces)\n- 1/4 cup Njangsa\n- 1/2 Tbsp Country Onions\n- 1/4 tsp mbongo spice\n- 1/2 medium Onions (1/4 sliced and 1/4 to be blended)\n- 1 small roma tomatoe\n- 1 clove garlic\n- 1 sprig Parsley\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n- 1/2 cup water\n- salt to taste\n- Scallions for garnish\n- 1 medium Habanero pepper\nInstructions\n1. Descale fish, thoroughly rinse and cut as shown. Transfer to a medium sauce pan.\n2. Blend Njangsa, parsley, garlic, habanero, tomaotoe, onions with 1/2 cup of water until smooth and creamy.\n3. Add to sauce pan. Then add country onions, mbongo spice, salt to taste. Turn heat to medium and simmer for about 20-25 minutes while stirring occasionally. Add more water if too thick.\n4. Meanwhile, in a small fry pan, heat vegetable oil and fry remaining onions until it starts to brown. Transfer into sauce pan with fish and cook for another 5-7 minutes.\n5. Serve with plantains ( Or Rice, African Yams, Coco yams and more)\nNotes\nPlantains Semi ripe plantains will cook quicker than green plantains. Depending on how ripe they are, you can cook for as little as 20 minutes. Wash and peel plantains before cooking so they are nice and soft. Some will boil without peeing; but not only does it take a little longer, they tend to be a little dry. If you insist on boiling without peeling, do wash thoroughly, trim ends and cut ( about 2 inch long) before boiling. You'll obviously need less water with semi-ripe to ripe plantains. If using green plantain, fill with water until plantains are completely covered.", "content_info": {"domain": "daily_life", "subdomain": "Cooking Tips, food knowledge, food preservation"}}}}

The grill temperature was between 425 to 450. Personally, using a grill pan is a must, it will make your life a lot easier when it's time to flip the fish. If grilling directly, make sure the grill is HOT! You don't want that skin to stick. Oil the fish using canola, avocado or another high heat oil. Start with skin side down and keep the grill closed. This keeps your grill temperature stable so your fish cooks evenly.\nPoisson Braise is customarily served with plantains or miondo . Here we have some sweet fried plantains, which you can find the recipe here and some hot sauces.

Plantains are obviously bigger in size, have a thicker skin and should be cooked. You want green bananas for this dish. These are from a local Asian store.

There are so many different varieties but today we are using this green cabbage or you can use savoy cabbage. Here from around November up until April , local farmers are probably growing some form of cabbage.\nWhen buying cabbage, ensure its a firm and tight head of cabbage. The size should almost match the weight. So a nice heavy feel. The looser leaves should be green and free of any spots.\nCOOKING THE CABBAGE\nCabbage can be eaten raw, sauteed, pan roasted,braised or grilled. A quick blanch is all you need here.\nStart by slicing the cabbage into small strips while you bring large pot of water to boil. Carefully add cabbage into boiling water and push down with a wooden spoon or ladle until you submerge. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Strain with a colander and immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking process.\nOnce cool enough to touch. Squeeze out as much water as you can. Grab a large handful and use both hands to squeeze out the excess water.\nTHE SAUCE\nMost of our dishes start with a base sauce, then we add leafy greens or other vegetables. In this case our sauce is peanut based. You boil raw peanuts for 10-15 minutes or until you can easily peel the skin. You can find raw peanuts at an Asian market or online. Blend this with garlic, onions and ginger. This is what makes this cabbage so creamy and nutty. Substitute peanuts with egusi, cashews or peeled almonds.\nBring in some color with some leafy greens, some kale, spinach , collards, turnips and more. Fufucorn is what we enjoy this Cameroonian stewed cabbage with but you can serve as a side.\nCAMEROONIAN STEWED CABBAGE\nPrep Time: 15 minutes mins, Cook Time: 25 minutes mins\nIngredients\nCABBAGE\n- 2 medium green cabbage sliced (About 6-7 heaping cups)\n- 2 cups chopped kale\n- 1 medium yellow onion sliced\n- 1 medium habanero\n- 4 cloves of garlic\n- 1/2 inch cube ginger\n- 4 medium Roma Tomatoes diced ((about 2 cups))\n- 1 cup boiled and peeled peanuts\n- 1-2 Tbsp canola oil\n- salt to taste\nBeef Stew Meat\n- ~1 lb beef stew meat with bones\n- 1 medium onion sliced\n- 2 Tbsp grated garlic\n- 2 tsp grated ginger\n- 3 cups of water\n- 1 tsp kosher salt\nInstructions\nBEEF\n1.

Spring may be about a month away but we are not out of the woods yet. They literally closed school for a few days because of the number of flu cases. You can grab an immunity shot at health foods store or grocery store for about $2.99 to $4.99 for a 2 ounce bottle. Here's a much cheaper route we love. For about $10 and with a little time we have enough of these carrot boost for our family. Here is all what you'll need to make them.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7845.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Temply.jpg?resize=576%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCARROT BOOST INGREDIENTS\nCarrots : This cool season root vegetable brings in the vibrant orange glow. Packing loads of beta carotene and anti oxidant properties, carrots bring in some natural sweetness.\nPineapple : Bringing in some tropical sweetness with lots of vitamin C. Pineapple has some anti-inflammatory and immune boosting properties. A digestive aid that works well with this carrot boost.\nGinger : We love the kick and you can add to taste. Ginger has long been praised for its ability to sooth the stomach, reduce nausea and also has some amazing anti-inflammatory properties.\nLemons : We welcome the tartness to help balance the sweetness from the carrots and pineapple. A champion in vitamin C. Most of our immunity drinks features lemons for a reason and this is no exception.\nTurmeric : Turmeric gets its distinct bright color from curcumin, a compound which has long been studied for its many health benefits. Just a little will suffice for the purpose of this immunity drink. We are using turmeric powder but feel free to use fresh turmeric if that is what you have.\nBlack peppe r: This helps us fully take advantage of the turmeric benefits by enhancing the absorption of Curcumin.\nWater : To blend, bring everything together and help with dilution.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/unnamed.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lemons.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCaption: GINGER\nMAKING THE CARROT BOOST\nGet organic produce if you can. You want to boost your immunity, its best to avoid introducing unwanted chemicals. Thoroughly wash carrots, pineapple, ginger and lemon. Scrape off carrot skin, peel pineapple and cut into small chunks. Peel lemon, removing as much of the white part of the rind as you can because this will bring an unpleasant bitterness.\nTransfer all ingredients into a high speed blender, then add water, black pepper and turmeric powder and blend until smooth.

Packing loads of beta carotene and anti oxidant properties, carrots bring in some natural sweetness.\nPineapple : Bringing in some tropical sweetness with lots of vitamin C. Pineapple has some anti-inflammatory and immune boosting properties. A digestive aid that works well with this carrot boost.\nGinger : We love the kick and you can add to taste. Ginger has long been praised for its ability to sooth the stomach, reduce nausea and also has some amazing anti-inflammatory properties.\nLemons : We welcome the tartness to help balance the sweetness from the carrots and pineapple. A champion in vitamin C. Most of our immunity drinks features lemons for a reason and this is no exception.\nTurmeric : Turmeric gets its distinct bright color from curcumin, a compound which has long been studied for its many health benefits. Just a little will suffice for the purpose of this immunity drink. We are using turmeric powder but feel free to use fresh turmeric if that is what you have.\nBlack peppe r: This helps us fully take advantage of the turmeric benefits by enhancing the absorption of Curcumin.\nWater : To blend, bring everything together and help with dilution.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/unnamed.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lemons.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCaption: GINGER\nMAKING THE CARROT BOOST\nGet organic produce if you can. You want to boost your immunity, its best to avoid introducing unwanted chemicals. Thoroughly wash carrots, pineapple, ginger and lemon. Scrape off carrot skin, peel pineapple and cut into small chunks. Peel lemon, removing as much of the white part of the rind as you can because this will bring an unpleasant bitterness.\nTransfer all ingredients into a high speed blender, then add water, black pepper and turmeric powder and blend until smooth.

{"ID": "c3b6d9bf58df55979426b538ad904252", "Text": "CHICKEN BASIL PESTO PIZZA\nChicken basil pesto pizza night is easy, quick and effortless. We have our favorite pizza spot but today we are going for fun family time with all tiny hands on deck. Cooking with kids can be quite messy but by using some store-bought ingredients, today is all fun and no mess. And if you're just cooking for yourself or two, this is sure going to be a quick, easy and enjoyable meal.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PIZZA.jpg?resize=777%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCHICKEN BASIL PESTO PIZZA INGREDIENTS\nWe love how quick this pizza dinner comes together. As much as make from scratch is right up our alley, some days we cut corners when we find the right ingredients.\n- Chicken Breast : Our favorite lean protein for pizza night. Cut into small chunks and get to seasoning . We used some dried basil, oregano, rosemary, salt and black pepper.\n- Basil Peso : Find your favorite basil pesTo brand, or if you make basil pesto at home even better.\n- Mozzarella and Parmesan Cheese: We love the dual cheese option. An additional sprinkle of Parmesan after baking just gives it another layer of flavor.\n- Pizza Dough : We found a good artisan pizza dough at our local grocery store. No specific recommendations so go for your favorite brand. We are using a pound of garlic and herb pizza dough made with whole wheat flour.\n- Olive oil : Greasing our baking sheet prevents the dough from sticking to the pan.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7746.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pesto-chicken-pizza.jpg?resize=513%2C1024&ssl=1]\nMAKING THE PIZZA\n- Cook the chicken: As mentioned we are seasoning our chicken with some dried basil, thyme , rosemary, oregano, salt and black pepper. If you have some Italian seasoning around, go for it. Cook with a little olive oil in a skillet until done. This should take abut 10 minutes or so depending on how small your chicken chunks are.\n- To enjoy that nice crispy crust that we love in a home oven, we par-bake before adding the toppings. Spread dough on to a greased 14 inch baking sheet and cook for 5-7 minutes (middle rack, oven preheated to 425) or until it can hold a shape. After, we will flip on a board and add our toppings.\n- To build the pizza, start with the pesto and spread a nice layer over the crust. Then add Mozzarella cheese, followed by halved cherry tomatoes, cooked chicken, greens and a handful of Parmesan cheese.

We have our favorite pizza spot but today we are going for fun family time with all tiny hands on deck. Cooking with kids can be quite messy but by using some store-bought ingredients, today is all fun and no mess. And if you're just cooking for yourself or two, this is sure going to be a quick, easy and enjoyable meal.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PIZZA.jpg?resize=777%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCHICKEN BASIL PESTO PIZZA INGREDIENTS\nWe love how quick this pizza dinner comes together. As much as make from scratch is right up our alley, some days we cut corners when we find the right ingredients.\n- Chicken Breast : Our favorite lean protein for pizza night. Cut into small chunks and get to seasoning . We used some dried basil, oregano, rosemary, salt and black pepper.\n- Basil Peso : Find your favorite basil pesTo brand, or if you make basil pesto at home even better.\n- Mozzarella and Parmesan Cheese: We love the dual cheese option. An additional sprinkle of Parmesan after baking just gives it another layer of flavor.\n- Pizza Dough : We found a good artisan pizza dough at our local grocery store. No specific recommendations so go for your favorite brand. We are using a pound of garlic and herb pizza dough made with whole wheat flour.\n- Olive oil : Greasing our baking sheet prevents the dough from sticking to the pan.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7746.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pesto-chicken-pizza.jpg?resize=513%2C1024&ssl=1]\nMAKING THE PIZZA\n- Cook the chicken: As mentioned we are seasoning our chicken with some dried basil, thyme , rosemary, oregano, salt and black pepper. If you have some Italian seasoning around, go for it. Cook with a little olive oil in a skillet until done. This should take abut 10 minutes or so depending on how small your chicken chunks are.\n- To enjoy that nice crispy crust that we love in a home oven, we par-bake before adding the toppings. Spread dough on to a greased 14 inch baking sheet and cook for 5-7 minutes (middle rack, oven preheated to 425) or until it can hold a shape. After, we will flip on a board and add our toppings.\n- To build the pizza, start with the pesto and spread a nice layer over the crust. Then add Mozzarella cheese, followed by halved cherry tomatoes, cooked chicken, greens and a handful of Parmesan cheese. Adjust cheese and pesto as you wish.\n- Finally, bake at 425 for 10-12 minutes or until cheese melts and crust is slightly brown.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pesto-Chicken-Pizza-night.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWe absolutely love how easy it is to put this meal together.

Sweet,a tart spicy and just one heck of a hearty plate. Can be enjoyed without the accompaniments if you're a raw vegan but plantains always have a home on my plate.\nTHE KALE\nNo wilt here! You hear the crunch? Give it an attempted squeeze. Hear it? That's what your going for. Kale is quite robust compared to other salad greens so we are really chopping the leaves here. Some say massage the kale. We are massaging with the knife so chop on. Almost minced.

Finely chop too. Almost like cauliflower rice consistency. Now we bring in a some extra crunch and kick from red onions; a little sweet and tart from craisins.\nTHE DRESSING\nCombine all in a bowl and give it a nice mix. I used my hands, so we give the kale a little more of that massage.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kale-salad-drizzle.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kale-salad-chopped.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCHICKPEAS\nThe croutons of the salad. Cut roasting time if you want a less crunchy bite. Simply seasoned with your favorite dry rub and some olive oil. Used my suya spice mix here . You can use canned chickpeas , but I do recommend you peel them. I cook my chickpeas, salted in the instapot.\nPLANTAINS\nSimply slice and deep or pan fry.

Sweet,a tart spicy and just one heck of a hearty plate. Can be enjoyed without the accompaniments if you're a raw vegan but plantains always have a home on my plate.\nTHE KALE\nNo wilt here! You hear the crunch? Give it an attempted squeeze. Hear it? That's what your going for. Kale is quite robust compared to other salad greens so we are really chopping the leaves here. Some say massage the kale. We are massaging with the knife so chop on. Almost minced. A food processor will do great here too.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kale.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nGiving it a little more body with some cauliflower. Finely chop too. Almost like cauliflower rice consistency. Now we bring in a some extra crunch and kick from red onions; a little sweet and tart from craisins.\nTHE DRESSING\nCombine all in a bowl and give it a nice mix. I used my hands, so we give the kale a little more of that massage.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kale-salad-drizzle.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kale-salad-chopped.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCHICKPEAS\nThe croutons of the salad. Cut roasting time if you want a less crunchy bite. Simply seasoned with your favorite dry rub and some olive oil. Used my suya spice mix here . You can use canned chickpeas , but I do recommend you peel them. I cook my chickpeas, salted in the instapot.\nPLANTAINS\nSimply slice and deep or pan fry.

A popular street food in most west African Countries. Typically a little sweeter with breakfast and less so with lunch as it is accompanied by different items. Today we are having puff puff with two \"non traditional\" tweaks because it is entering the dessert corner. Cinnamon sugar puff puff . Right out of the fryer, piping hot they are tossed in some cinnamon sugar. And then right before serving drizzled with some caramel sauce.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/puff-puff.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nALL YOU NEED\nYeast, flour, sugar, salt and oil for frying.\nUse dry active yeast. I store opened yeast jars in the fridge to keep it fresh, or you can use the packets.\nAll purpose flour is preferred but whole wheat works just fine too.\nMake it as sweet as your heart desires. With savory meals, it is best to cut down on the sugar. Let your flavor wheel of fortune turn here. Feel free to add some vanilla extract, allspice, nutmeg. lemon zest, you name it. Here we are keeping it simple and finishing off with some cinnamon sugar and caramel sauce.\nMAKING PUFF PUFF\nTypically I prefer to add my yeast to lukewarm water, before adding the other ingredients. Some will combine all the dry ingredients including the yeast then add water. Either is fine with me.\nThen add in your dry ingredients, mix well with hand or whisk. Up till date, my mother NEVER measures anything with puff puff. She feels the consistency with and decides whether to add more flour or not.\nDont worry, we measured here, but I still prefer to feel so I use my hands to mix. After this, set aside to rise for at least 45 minutes in a warm area. We live in Tennessee, I just take my bowl, covered to the back patio.\nAt the end it should rise to at least double the amount.\nFRYING PUFF PUFF\nYou can use a spoon to scoop the dough and drop in the oil but the hand scoop technique is the way to go. You stay consistent in size and i honestly find it therapeutic. Try not to overcrowd but don't let it be scanty either. Test the oil with a dough drop, it should rise right away. Some miraculously flip on their own, but you want to flip when its just golden brown.\nDrain excess oil on a paper towel.\nLight crisp outside, fluffy inside. Delectable!\nEnjoy as is or be extra. Toss in some cinnamon sugar and drizzle some caramel sauce.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/puff-puff-bowl.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWe could seriously eat these cinnamon sugar puff puff all day but we can't now can we?! Sinfully delicious. And even though we do not eat puff puff every day, when we do, we go all out no guilt. Hope you enjoy making this as much as we did.

A popular street food in most west African Countries. Typically a little sweeter with breakfast and less so with lunch as it is accompanied by different items. Today we are having puff puff with two \"non traditional\" tweaks because it is entering the dessert corner. Cinnamon sugar puff puff . Right out of the fryer, piping hot they are tossed in some cinnamon sugar. And then right before serving drizzled with some caramel sauce.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/puff-puff.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nALL YOU NEED\nYeast, flour, sugar, salt and oil for frying.\nUse dry active yeast. I store opened yeast jars in the fridge to keep it fresh, or you can use the packets.\nAll purpose flour is preferred but whole wheat works just fine too.\nMake it as sweet as your heart desires. With savory meals, it is best to cut down on the sugar. Let your flavor wheel of fortune turn here. Feel free to add some vanilla extract, allspice, nutmeg. lemon zest, you name it. Here we are keeping it simple and finishing off with some cinnamon sugar and caramel sauce.\nMAKING PUFF PUFF\nTypically I prefer to add my yeast to lukewarm water, before adding the other ingredients. Some will combine all the dry ingredients including the yeast then add water. Either is fine with me.\nThen add in your dry ingredients, mix well with hand or whisk. Up till date, my mother NEVER measures anything with puff puff. She feels the consistency with and decides whether to add more flour or not.\nDont worry, we measured here, but I still prefer to feel so I use my hands to mix. After this, set aside to rise for at least 45 minutes in a warm area. We live in Tennessee, I just take my bowl, covered to the back patio.\nAt the end it should rise to at least double the amount.\nFRYING PUFF PUFF\nYou can use a spoon to scoop the dough and drop in the oil but the hand scoop technique is the way to go. You stay consistent in size and i honestly find it therapeutic. Try not to overcrowd but don't let it be scanty either. Test the oil with a dough drop, it should rise right away. Some miraculously flip on their own, but you want to flip when its just golden brown.\nDrain excess oil on a paper towel.\nLight crisp outside, fluffy inside. Delectable!\nEnjoy as is or be extra. Toss in some cinnamon sugar and drizzle some caramel sauce.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/puff-puff-bowl.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWe could seriously eat these cinnamon sugar puff puff all day but we can't now can we?! Sinfully delicious. And even though we do not eat puff puff every day, when we do, we go all out no guilt. Hope you enjoy making this as much as we did.

{"ID": "f71afb36c7e9128e5a37736be5f3eb9f", "Text": "Lightly Salted Crunchy Oven roasted Peanuts\nIf there is one ingredient that screams west African cuisine, that will be peanuts. Our well-known West African Peanut stew, commonly called groundnut soup . They can be featured in basically every meal and enjoyed in all its forms. Fresh, roasted , boiled, you name it.\nCrunchy Oven Roasted Peanuts\nOne of my favorite ways to enjoy peanuts is by roasting it. I remember growing up and snacking on these amazingly delicious and crunchy roasted peanuts. The vendors will have roasted peanuts and corn in these little carts they roll down busy streets and markets. Corn and Groundnut. Those who grew up in Cameroon will understand how treasured this snack was. They don't peel the peanuts until a customers orders. They put on quite the show let me tell ya. Once you order, they scoop up the roasted peanuts into a bowl. Next thing you see is the guy throwing peanuts in the air and catching with the bowl like its a circus. Oh and not one single gain of peanut is lost. Yes I said guy because all the times I bought this, the vendor was male. During the final two or three air toss, you see peels flying and a clear catch of peeled peanuts. I swear its magical you'll have to see it.\nI love making these at home because I can control the salt and crunch. A great snack to have around and super easy to make. First off you have to use the right peanuts. After trying a few other kinds, Spanish style peanuts are my favorite. You can buy the raw peanuts online or from your local grocery store. Once you've don't this once at home , you'll seriously reconsider ever buying salted peanuts from the store. No more \"Lightly Salted\" for one person and \"Too much salt\" for another. Eliminate that confusion and decide whether to salt or add other flavors to you fancy.\nBRINING\nAs previously mentioned , we are stating with some raw Spanish peanuts. Soak in some salted water overnight. Its just like brining your turkey for thanksgiving. The peanuts soak up the salted water. Taste the raw peanuts, they already are delicious even before roasting. This gives you an idea to how salty they'll be. If they taste too salty, soak them again for a few hours in plain water. This should help somewhat unless you really over did it with the salt.\nROASTING\nOven temperature and time will determine how crunchy they get. I'm at home with my little one all day so no rush. It took about an hour and a half for this batch. Starting with 250 then increasing to 300 degrees. You can definitely go for a shorter time and higher oven temperature. You might the ge With the overnight soak, the low start slowly cook the peanuts, drying out the water. Carefully give the cookie sheet a nice shake a few times for even roasting. Its quite interesting tasting along the different stages of roasting. I'm amazed there is some left with my too many tastings.\nAt one point you get the boiled peanut taste. You want to keep roasting until they are dry enough ( The noisy shake.....use some oven mittens , no burns!) Some of the nuts will split and some will start losing their skin. Remove from the oven and let cool off completely. Its easier to peel.\nPEELING AND STORING.\nTo peel , I rub them between my palms several times, the skin easily fall of. I don't mind if they break, this is for household consumption. Not sure why someone will care so much about their peanuts not being whole but oh well...to each thy own. After this , I usually take the tray to the back yard, give it a toss while blowing to get rid of the skin. Select and peel they once with skin still one.\nEt Voila! Crunchy, lightly salted oven roasted peanuts. Not only are they a great snack they make amazing gifts. As a matter of fact I'm making a bigger batch and mailing to my friends. This brings back way too many high school memories. I just have to remind them who we are and where we came from once more. Back home, a tightly sealed plastic bottle of roasted peanuts is a must for a boarding school kid. ( All my professional garri drinkers). You can also seal in a glass bottle or mason jar. Just make sure its air tight.\nHope you get to try and enjoy this one. Simply delicious! And you can use this to make our beef peanut soup or this amazing Cacao Peanut Butter . Just watch the salt as these are salted.\nYou'll love it.\nLIGHTLY SALTED CRUNCHY OVEN ROASTED PEANUTS\nPrep Time: 5 minutes mins, Cook Time: 1 hour hr 30 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 and 1/2 Cups Spanish style peanuts ((with skin))\n- 1 tsp Kosher salt\n- 1 Cup of water\nInstructions\n1. Combine peanuts , salt and water into a bowl. Water level should be about half an inch over peanuts. Soak overnight. In the morning most of the water should have been absorbed by the peanuts. Drain remaining water.\n2. Pre heat oven 250 degrees Farenheit. Layer peanuts on a baking sheet and roast for about an hour until most of the water dries off but still chewy. Increase temperature to 300 and continue to cook for another 30 minutes or until the desired crunch is attained. Remove from oven and let cool completely\n3. To peel, rub between your palms several times. Take outside, give the cookie sheet a toss while blowing to separate the peanuts from the peels.

You want to keep roasting until they are dry enough ( The noisy shake.....use some oven mittens , no burns!) Some of the nuts will split and some will start losing their skin. Remove from the oven and let cool off completely. Its easier to peel.\nPEELING AND STORING.\nTo peel , I rub them between my palms several times, the skin easily fall of. I don't mind if they break, this is for household consumption. Not sure why someone will care so much about their peanuts not being whole but oh well...to each thy own. After this , I usually take the tray to the back yard, give it a toss while blowing to get rid of the skin. Select and peel they once with skin still one.\nEt Voila! Crunchy, lightly salted oven roasted peanuts. Not only are they a great snack they make amazing gifts. As a matter of fact I'm making a bigger batch and mailing to my friends. This brings back way too many high school memories. I just have to remind them who we are and where we came from once more. Back home, a tightly sealed plastic bottle of roasted peanuts is a must for a boarding school kid. ( All my professional garri drinkers). You can also seal in a glass bottle or mason jar. Just make sure its air tight.\nHope you get to try and enjoy this one. Simply delicious! And you can use this to make our beef peanut soup or this amazing Cacao Peanut Butter . Just watch the salt as these are salted.\nYou'll love it.\nLIGHTLY SALTED CRUNCHY OVEN ROASTED PEANUTS\nPrep Time: 5 minutes mins, Cook Time: 1 hour hr 30 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 and 1/2 Cups Spanish style peanuts ((with skin))\n- 1 tsp Kosher salt\n- 1 Cup of water\nInstructions\n1.

Increase temperature to 300 and continue to cook for another 30 minutes or until the desired crunch is attained. Remove from oven and let cool completely\n3.

It has significant antioxidant properties and also loaded with vitamins and amino acids. There is something about a cup of Matcha, be it warm or on ice. And that frothy goodness that makes you feel like you're visiting your favorite tea shop but in sweatpants. No latte art here but the fact that you still see some frothiness down to your last sip definitely speaks volume about this little trick.\nMILK OPTIONS\nHere we are using almond milk.

All you do is steep your tea bags or favorite loose leaf teas in room temperature water and let the sun have at it. You can sun brew for up to 3-4 hours but its recommended to keep it under 4 hours. With sun tea brewed at a lower temperature comparably, there is some worries about bacteria growth. That being said, the risk is low to negligible if you follow simple sanitation procedures to prevent contamination. It is best to refrigerate right away and we typically drink up the batch made within a day.\nEASY HIBISCUS SUN TEA BREWING\nWe start of with some quality ingredients. Find the best dried Sorrel you can lay your hands on, some fresh ginger, lemon and mint. Thoroughly wash your ingredients and peel ginger. Wash and sanitize a desired sized glass mason jar with a tight seal. Add all ingredients into jar, pour water to cover and seal. Set this under the sun for about 2 hours. It's important to not add any sweeteners while brewing. Again we are brewing at a much lower temperature than regular teas.\nSERVING SUN TEAS\nWe brew sun teas when the summer heat is sometimes unbearable so it is very obvious that we serve over ice. In my humble opinion they make the easiest and most refreshing infused iced teas ever. After brewing, depending on what other flavors you infused floating along side your tea, strain . Then sweeten to your hearts desire or just enjoy as is over ice.\nWhen I polled how many people have heard about sun teas on my Instagram, I realized they are not really known to most.

A little something different and such a great twist to this stew. When you think of stew most will imagine potatoes and all else that comes with it. Well today, we are going with coco yams.\nCoco yams ( Taro)\nThese starchy roots are common in Cameroon. Sometimes we boil them, skin on, peel and pound into a smooth dough called fufu. We serve this with a traditional palm oil soup in a dish called Achu. Another staple we enjoy with coco yams is a spicy pottage made with palm oil, crayfish and other spices. I must say this stew is a first with coco yams adding a much needed substance to the dish. There are different kinds of coco yams, these have a little redness to the flesh when peeled. You can check this by snapping a little end from the root when buying. These will bake and do a little better in the stew than the white ones. You can find these at an African or Asian grocery store.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_4232.jpg?resize=1920%2C1280&ssl=1]\nPreparing Coco Yams\nDouble wash, this is optional. Wash, then peel off the skin to reveal the white flesh. Wash this again before slicing into chunks for boiling. Coco yams contain chemicals that will cause severe itching when raw and under cooked. Wear gloves during second wash or peeling. Add enough water to completely submerge coco yams and about and inch over, add salt and cook until soft. Drizzle some olive oil, some white pepper, toss and broil until they just start to char. These are amazing in the stew or just to snack on.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_4231.jpg?resize=1280%2C1853&ssl=1]\nThe goat meat we use here is the frozen left overs from the Christmas crowd. We were granted a one day pass to the restaurant depot and we couldn't pass on the amazing halal goat meat deal. Matter of fact, I still have quite a bit left for future use. A little tip from my mother this holiday is applied to this dish. With goat meat , we usually enjoy some goat meat pepper soup. It is best to add in your spices and cook for a little while before adding water. This lets your meat absorb the seasoning that short cook time. The meat releases some water as it cooks.

{"ID": "df2c32c52fe84473007943369a5338cb", "Text": "HEARTY KALE SALAD\nHearty kale salad with Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, dried cranberries and a zesty mayo dressing to boot. A sweet and crunchy bite even my pickiest eater devoured.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kale-salad-recipe.jpg?resize=1280%2C1920&ssl=1]\nWHAT TYPE OF KALE TO USE FOR KALE SALAD\nThere are several varieties of kale but lets focus on the two you are likely to fine at the grocery store. Common curly kale and Lacinato kale. As you can see below, the curly kale is pale to dark green with ruffled leaves. Lacinato kale on the other hand has more of a dark greenish blue color with leaves that are more wrinkled than ruffled. For this salad we are using the curly kale. Lacinto kale packs a little more bite. With a more robust flavor it is best to saute, use in soups or in this kale chips recipe.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kale-leaves.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kale.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nINGREDIENTS FOR KALE SALAD\nYou can easily make this salad a main meal. Ingredients were curated with macros in mind.\n- Cauliflower - This edible flower brings in a sweet crunchy bite alongside its richness in vitamins and folate\n- Brussels Sprouts - I must confess my kids dislike these with a passion. Keeping it raw and shredded like we did here, is a game changer! They will never know! They are rich in vitamins, minerals and thus some anti-inflammatory properties.\n- Dried Cranberries - That chewy bite of sweetened cranberries adds to the different textures which brings this salad together.\n- Hemp hearts -Bringing in some good fats and protein\n- Red Onion - Adds a little punch to balance the sweetness from the dried cranberries and the salad dressing.\nHOW TO PREPARE SALAD INGREDIENTS\nThe most labor intensive part of this salad is the chopping. Once that is all done, all you do is throw ingredients into a salad bowl and mix.\nKale- We are using a food processor to do all the work for us. Start by thoroughly washing your kale, remove the tough midrib and dry. Transfer a handful at a time into a food processor and pulse into small shreds. Now you've probably heard people say, \" massage the kale\", especially if you are using very mature leaves. This makes all the good fiber easy to digest and definitely tastier. Here we drizzle a little avocado oil, a pinch of salt and with clean hands give them a good firm rub between the fingers and palm. Do this for a couple of minutes or so.\nCauliflower - Cut curds into small chunks and pulse in the food processor. Almost the same consistency as cauliflower rice\nBrussels Sprouts - Remove the tough ends, cut into halves and pulse into small shreds.\nRed Onion and Craisins - Finely chop both to a similar size as the other ingredients.\nAlternatively, you can use the shredding blade on your food processor to make this a shredded salad. You can also use a mandoline slice\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kale-salad.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTHE SALAD DRESSING\nThis dressing is my all time favorite, a little tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. This is the main reason my daughters enjoy this salad, and we sure are very generous with it.\nMayonnaise - We are using real mayo but if you're vegan follow your heart vegenaise is a great substitute\nHoney Ginger Balsamic - Any white balsamic vinegar will work but this has the sweetness with a little kick from the ginger.\nLemon Juice - An essential to balance out our mayo. Alternatively, you can also use distilled vinegar.\nYellow mustard - The sharpness complements the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar.\nCane sugar - The sweetness marries well, not only with the other components of the dressing but also the robustness of the kale.\nMAKE IT YOUR OWN\nThere are so many ways you can revamp this recipe. Bring in other sources of proteins, fats and so much more. The options are endless but here are a few of our favorites.\nProtein : Roasted chickpeas, Tofu crumbles\nCarbs: Orzo, Couscous, roasted sweet potatoes\nFats: Avocado, nuts, pumpkin seeds, feta or parmesan cheese\nThis salad is one of the easiest way to use all those cool season produce to make something amazing. Hope you get to savor it as much as we do. Enjoy, and do share with us what you've been enjoying from the afrovitalityeats kitchen.\nHEARTY KALE SALAD\nHearty kale salad with Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, dried cranberries and a zesty mayo dressing boot.

Start by thoroughly washing your kale, remove the tough midrib and dry. Transfer a handful at a time into a food processor and pulse into small shreds. Now you've probably heard people say, \" massage the kale\", especially if you are using very mature leaves. This makes all the good fiber easy to digest and definitely tastier. Here we drizzle a little avocado oil, a pinch of salt and with clean hands give them a good firm rub between the fingers and palm. Do this for a couple of minutes or so.\nCauliflower - Cut curds into small chunks and pulse in the food processor. Almost the same consistency as cauliflower rice\nBrussels Sprouts - Remove the tough ends, cut into halves and pulse into small shreds.\nRed Onion and Craisins - Finely chop both to a similar size as the other ingredients.\nAlternatively, you can use the shredding blade on your food processor to make this a shredded salad. You can also use a mandoline slice\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kale-salad.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTHE SALAD DRESSING\nThis dressing is my all time favorite, a little tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. This is the main reason my daughters enjoy this salad, and we sure are very generous with it.\nMayonnaise - We are using real mayo but if you're vegan follow your heart vegenaise is a great substitute\nHoney Ginger Balsamic - Any white balsamic vinegar will work but this has the sweetness with a little kick from the ginger.\nLemon Juice - An essential to balance out our mayo. Alternatively, you can also use distilled vinegar.\nYellow mustard - The sharpness complements the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar.\nCane sugar - The sweetness marries well, not only with the other components of the dressing but also the robustness of the kale.\nMAKE IT YOUR OWN\nThere are so many ways you can revamp this recipe. Bring in other sources of proteins, fats and so much more. The options are endless but here are a few of our favorites.\nProtein : Roasted chickpeas, Tofu crumbles\nCarbs: Orzo, Couscous, roasted sweet potatoes\nFats: Avocado, nuts, pumpkin seeds, feta or parmesan cheese\nThis salad is one of the easiest way to use all those cool season produce to make something amazing. Hope you get to savor it as much as we do. Enjoy, and do share with us what you've been enjoying from the afrovitalityeats kitchen.\nHEARTY KALE SALAD\nHearty kale salad with Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, dried cranberries and a zesty mayo dressing boot. A sweet and crunchy bite even my pickiest eater devoured.\nPrep Time: 15 minutes mins, Cook Time: 5 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 3 cups of chopped Kale\n- 2 cups of chopped Brussels Sprouts\n- 2 cups of chopped Cauliflower\n- 1/3 cup chopped dried cranberries ((adjust as needed))\n- 1/4 cup finely diced Red Onion\n- 2 Tbsp Hemp hearts\nSalad Dressing\n- 6 Tbsp Mayonnaise\n- 3 Tbsp Honey ginger balsamic vinegar\n- 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n- 1/2 Tbsp Yellow mustard\n- 1 Tbsp Cane sugar\nInstructions\nHOW TO PREPARE THE SALAD INGREDIENTS\n1. Kale - Transfer a handful of kale leaves into a food processor and pulse into small shreds. Make 3 cups and transfer into a salad bowl. Add 1/2 Tablespoon of avocado oil, a pinch of salt and massage for 2 minutes. Set aside\n2. Cauliflower -Cut curds into small chunks and pulse in the food processor. Almost the same consistency as cauliflower rice. You need 2 cups.\n3. Brussels Sprouts -Remove the tough ends, cut into halves. Use a food processor and pulse into small shreds. You need 2 cups\n4. Red Onion and Dried Cranberries - Finely chop both to a similar size as the other ingredients. You need 1/4 cup red onions and 1/3 cup Craisins\nHOW TO MAKE THE SALAD DRESSING\n1. Combine all ingredients into a small hand blender and blend for 15 seconds. Set aside.\nTO BUILD THE KALE SALAD\n1.

The flavor, color and nutritional value is untouched. Even better is, once you are done with the infusion, you can use them for baking. Think tarts, pies, crumbles, baked goods in general. The entire flower is edible. My kids actually just snack on them.\n- Cane Sugar : This is essential here but you can also use honey, maple syrup or agave.\n- And of course, water to dissolve the sugar.\nThese are the 3 simple ingredients needed to bring this syrup into your home kitchen\nCAN YOU USE DRIED CALYCES ?\nYou sure can. The chances of you finding them fresh at your local grocery store or farmers' market are pretty low but if you do, grab them! Like previously mentioned, these were grown in our backyard garden.

Not only is it delicious, but it also boasts some pretty amazing benefits.\nDon't replace your blood pressure medication with hibiscus but it could help control blood pressure due to its diuretic effects.\nIt is also anti-inflammatory and rich in antioxidants which have been shown to play a role in disease prevention.\nNatural dye vs synthetic: Now imagine if every synthetic red dye was replaced with the compounds responsible for the naturally beautiful red of hibiscus or other plants.

Grab those colorful straws for the ultimate Slurpee effect!\nEnjoy this kid friendly hibiscus tropical bliss all summer long or year round. We won't judge. We will if you don't share though. So invite your friends over and have fun with this one.\nHIBISCUS TROPICAL BLISS\nA delightful caffeine free thirst quenching treat for all this summer.

You can use all whole eggs, but we are using egg whites here to cut down on the cholesterol from eggs.\n- Bell pepper : We are bringing in our beloved sweet bell pepper as a colorful, low calorie and vitamin rich veggie friend. Feel free to use, red, orange or green bell peppers. They are all rich in antioxidants and quite nutritious.\n- Spinach : A nutrient dense anti-inflammatory favorite that brings in a beautiful color to this dish\n- Heavy Cream : Whisked with the eggs to give it that rich, airy bite. Especially important if you are using lean ground turkey meat (93/7)\n- Sharp Cheddar : Brings in the savory element and a nice golden-brown crust to the edges.\nMAKE IT YOUR OWN\nThere is so much you can do to this bake to make it your own.\nAdd Potatoes : Adding in some shredded hashbrowns makes it even more substantial and a little more affordable too.

You can also use unsweetened nut milks or rice milk.\nAnother lean protein alternative you can use is ground chicken. And if you are vegetarian scrambling some tofu in place of the ground turkey is a great option. Other options that are not lean and bring in a little more fat are sausage, bacon or ham.\nGreens always are a great way to add some color. A great alternative to spinach is Swiss chard (chopped leaves) or kale.

Add ground turkey into a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook , while stirring and breaking up chunks until there is no more pink (~5 minutes). Then add in chopped bell peppers, 2 Tablespoons of water and cook until peppers are just tender (~5-7 minutes).\n2. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper\n3.

{"ID": "037aea938105d56ab534dd90f57d2f85", "Text": "HOW TO MAKE KOKI CORN\nKoki corn, is a traditional corn pudding made with blended fresh sweet corn, wrapped in banana or plantain leaves and steamed into a firm dough. Delicious, comforting and a true reflection of how simple, fresh ingredients make the best meals.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-pudding.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWHICH CORN TO USE FOR KOKI CORN\nIn Cameroon, the arrival of the rainy season signifies the arrival of one of my favorites, fresh corn. Growing up we cultivated corn and it has always been staple in our diet. From breakfast items like bouille, through other traditional dishes like fufu corn , cornchaff and more. The corn we use for koki corn is naturally sweet and typically used within a day of harvest. This might not be the ideal for everyone but you can still enjoy this dish without a nearby farm or freshly harvested corn.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-ingredients.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/corn.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nToday we are using some frozen super sweet corn. You can also use canned corn or frozen cream corn (frozen cream corn seem to contain more than corn which we try to avoid as much as we can).\nINGREDIENTS FOR KOKI CORN AND SUBSTITUTES\nFresh frozen corn: This pudding has a nice natural sweetness to it from the corn(no sugar added). Freshly harvested sweet corn or super sweet frozen corn is best. Soak the frozen corn in warm water until thawed and strain or you can thaw overnight in the fridge before use.\nCorn meal : We are using yellow cornmeal here to help firm up the pudding. Traditionally, freshly harvested corn from Cameroon, once blended for the pudding has a thicker consistency and will naturally form a firm dough. The frozen corn, once blended is a little more runny and if cooked outwith cornmeal, results in a softer pudding.\nFresh Kale : This brings some color to the pudding and also added greens. In Cameroon, we use cocoyam leaves. You can also use spinach, fresh or frozen. Note that spinach has a higher water content, you will need to take that into consideration when preparing your pudding mixture.\nPalm oil: We add a little palm oil for flavor and color. This is optional yet irreplaceable. If you choose to omit, you cannot substitute with any other oils.\nSeasoning: What makes this dish special is its simplicity. All you need is salt and a hot pepper if you want some heat.\nPlantain of Banana leaves (and aluminum foil) : If you can get your hands on these, do. There is a reason our ancestors prepared food in leaves. The flavor impact in unbeatable. You can use aluminum foil if that is all what you have access to. A local Asian grocery store may have banana leaves.\nHOW TO MAKE KOKI CORN\nTo prepare the corn, soak the frozen corn in warm water until thawed and strain or you can thaw overnight in the fridge before use. Blend in a food processor or high power blender with no water added until smooth. You want it creamy with a little texture. Feel free to scoop out about half a cup of roughly blended corn if your super charger blender completely pulverizes everything.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-mix-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\nIf you are using palm oil, warm for about a minute and add into the freshly blended corn. Again this is for color and flavor. A little goes a long way. Then add enough cornmeal to slightly thicken the blended corn. If you add a little too much cornmeal, you will be obliged to add water, so a little at a time. Too much cornmeal will also impact the sweetness of your koki corn. Season with some salt and hot pepper.\nLastly bring in some color with your chopped greens, be it kale , spinach or if you're lucky cocoyam leaves. Again, more spinach, higher water content and once cooked, dough will be slightly softer than if you use kale or cocoyam leaves.\nHOW TO WRAP KOKI CORN.\nPrepare the banana leaves.\nMake banana leaves pliable by setting into warm water for about 15 to 20 minutes. **Traditionally we run the banana leaves quickly over open flames** . Carefully rinse leaves, then with a knife, gently cut out any midrib left over from the leaf, ensuring you do not tear it.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-wrap-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-wrap.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTo wrap, cut out a foot of banana leaves. Scoop about a cup of dough unto the edge of the leaf, leaving about a quarter inch room from edge . Carefully roll a few times until you use up all the leaf. Then pull in edges to close. Using the same technique, wrap rolled koki corn with foil and tightly seal. Continue until all of the dough is used.\nCOOKING KOKI CORN\nKoki corn is steamed until dough firms up. A few important tips to ensure you get the best possible results.\nPrevent burns. Line your pot with some banana leaves, or if you have some corn husks even better. This prevents direct contact with the pot if in that one instance you let the water dry out! No burns! This also prevents water from leaking into your dough ( The foil wrap!!!! make it tight!)\nGet a head start on cooking : When you are half way through wrapping your koki corn, add water into your prepared pot and bring it to a boil. This gets the steam going for a jump start in cooking.\nDo not submerge the dough . Water will always find a way in if you do. So placing the dough seam side up with the water below the seam is important. You will have to add more hot water at some point. Lock in the steam by placing more leaves over wrapped koki corn before closing your pot.\nAvoid high heat: As much as you may want things to cook as fast as you'll like, avoid cranking up the heat. Vigorous boiling runs the risk of getting water into your koki corn and also burning. Be patient, you'll enjoy the end results.\nCook for at least forty five minutes to an hour.\nSERVING KOKI CORN\nWhen ready, carefully remove dough and let cool until it is comfortable to touch before opening. This also lets it firm up more. We love our meals so much sometimes we forget they are side dishes. Enjoy this side dish with protein of choice. Fell free to serve with a hot pepper sauce on the side.\nENJOY!\nKOKI CORN, CAMEROON CORN PUDDING\nKoki corn, is a traditional corn pudding made with blended fresh sweet corn, wrapped in banana or plantain leaves and steamed into a firm dough. Delicious, comforting and a true reflection of how simple, fresh ingredients make the best meals.\nPrep Time: 30 minutes mins, Cook Time: 1 hour hr\nIngredients\n- 4 cups frozen super sweet corn ((measure after thawing!))\n- 1/2 cup yellow corn meal\n- 1-2 Tablespoons palm oil\n- 2 Tablespoons warm water\n- 1 tsp kosher salt\n- 1 cup chopped baby kale ((or fresh spinach-Feel free to add more))\n- Banana or plantain leaves for wrapping ((or aluminum foil))\nInstructions\n1. Soak the frozen corn in warm water until thawed and strain. Using a food processor or blend high power blender, blend with no water added until smooth. (You can blend with a fresh scotch bonnet pepper if you want some heat)\n2. Warm palm oil in microwave for about a minute and add into the freshly blended corn. Then mix well.\n3. Add enough cornmeal to slightly thicken the blended corn. You should have a soft paste. If too much cornmeal is added, add a little warm water to thin.\n4. Season with salt, then add in chopped kale.\n5. To wrap, cut out a foot of banana leaves. Scoop about a cup of dough unto the edge of the leaf, leaving about a quarter inch room from edge . Carefully roll a few times until you use up the leaf. Then pull in edges to close. Using the same technique, wrap banana leaf rolled koki corn with foil and tightly seal. Continue until all of the dough is used.\n6. Line a large cooker with some banana leaves then add in water and bring to a gentle simmer. Carefully place wrapped koki corn, seam side up, then cover with more banana leaves, or foil to lock in steam before closing the pot. Koki corn SHOULD NOT be submerged. Water should be below seam.\n7. Cook for about an hour until dough firms up. Check periodically, adding hot water around the corners to prevent burning.\n8. When ready, carefully remove dough from pot and let it cool until you can comfortably remove foil.\n9. Then peel off banana leaves and serve.

Growing up we cultivated corn and it has always been staple in our diet. From breakfast items like bouille, through other traditional dishes like fufu corn , cornchaff and more. The corn we use for koki corn is naturally sweet and typically used within a day of harvest. This might not be the ideal for everyone but you can still enjoy this dish without a nearby farm or freshly harvested corn.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-ingredients.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/corn.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nToday we are using some frozen super sweet corn. You can also use canned corn or frozen cream corn (frozen cream corn seem to contain more than corn which we try to avoid as much as we can).\nINGREDIENTS FOR KOKI CORN AND SUBSTITUTES\nFresh frozen corn: This pudding has a nice natural sweetness to it from the corn(no sugar added). Freshly harvested sweet corn or super sweet frozen corn is best. Soak the frozen corn in warm water until thawed and strain or you can thaw overnight in the fridge before use.\nCorn meal : We are using yellow cornmeal here to help firm up the pudding. Traditionally, freshly harvested corn from Cameroon, once blended for the pudding has a thicker consistency and will naturally form a firm dough. The frozen corn, once blended is a little more runny and if cooked outwith cornmeal, results in a softer pudding.\nFresh Kale : This brings some color to the pudding and also added greens. In Cameroon, we use cocoyam leaves. You can also use spinach, fresh or frozen. Note that spinach has a higher water content, you will need to take that into consideration when preparing your pudding mixture.\nPalm oil: We add a little palm oil for flavor and color. This is optional yet irreplaceable. If you choose to omit, you cannot substitute with any other oils.\nSeasoning: What makes this dish special is its simplicity. All you need is salt and a hot pepper if you want some heat.\nPlantain of Banana leaves (and aluminum foil) : If you can get your hands on these, do. There is a reason our ancestors prepared food in leaves. The flavor impact in unbeatable. You can use aluminum foil if that is all what you have access to. A local Asian grocery store may have banana leaves.\nHOW TO MAKE KOKI CORN\nTo prepare the corn, soak the frozen corn in warm water until thawed and strain or you can thaw overnight in the fridge before use. Blend in a food processor or high power blender with no water added until smooth. You want it creamy with a little texture. Feel free to scoop out about half a cup of roughly blended corn if your super charger blender completely pulverizes everything.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/koki-corn-mix-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1]\nIf you are using palm oil, warm for about a minute and add into the freshly blended corn. Again this is for color and flavor. A little goes a long way. Then add enough cornmeal to slightly thicken the blended corn. If you add a little too much cornmeal, you will be obliged to add water, so a little at a time. Too much cornmeal will also impact the sweetness of your koki corn. Season with some salt and hot pepper.\nLastly bring in some color with your chopped greens, be it kale , spinach or if you're lucky cocoyam leaves. Again, more spinach, higher water content and once cooked, dough will be slightly softer than if you use kale or cocoyam leaves.\nHOW TO WRAP KOKI CORN.\nPrepare the banana leaves.\nMake banana leaves pliable by setting into warm water for about 15 to 20 minutes. **Traditionally we run the banana leaves quickly over open flames** .

My complete Camair plate! I gave my mom a curious look when I saw her grabbing bunches of turnip greens at the store. \"E de like njama njama\" she says. Njama Njama, as we call it, is the African huckleberry plant. A well loved green by most back home especially those from the north west province. Traditionally, it is steamed and sauteed with some palm oil, salt and pepper. Sometimes others doctor it up with tomatoes, meats and other condiments.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Turnip-Greens.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCaption: TURNIP GREENS\nMy mother definitely opened the way with turnip greens in our home. I must say I had never worked with turnip greens before. Nowadays, its rare that I don't grab at least a bunch or two each grocery run.\nGrab the freshest bunch. Yes, you will find me digging through to grab the bottom bunch. Sometime in March, per my very generous neighbor, we will have some turnip greens from his garden. We will be featuring those on our Launch Party menu this summer. Keep up the communications if you're here in Tennessee. You may just win a free pass to sample some amazing West African staples.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sliced-Turnip-Greens.jpg?resize=762%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTreating these as I treat njama njama, we start off by washing and slicing. This is then cooked, not just blanched because we want it a little softer and will need more than a couple minutes in boiling water. Transfer into an ice bath ( never did this with njama njama).\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blanched-Turnip-Greens.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nUse both hands to squeeze out excess water. At this point you are ready to sautee or freeze for future use. Kept it simple with some Onions, roma tomatoes and a little canola oil.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Turnip-greens-cooked.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTrust me, if your turnip greens were boring before, you've found your fix with this recipe. So simple , yet each bite makes you wonder how something so simple could taste so good. I still remember my mother cooking Njama Njama. We'll call it \"poor man njama njama\", with just palm oil, salt and pepper. Yet , our plates were wiped clean in record time. No \"eat your greens \" fight necessary, we loved it.\nKati Kati or Khati Khati\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kati-Kati-chicken.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-spicy-cameroon-chicken.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nAnother favorite. Fire grilled chicken, cooked in palm oil and tomato base sauce boasting some wonderful traditional flavors. I can't get enough of Kati kati. I've gone as far as making tacos with this chicken recipe. My corn tortillas become my fufu corn. That simple, we try it all with the same amazing taste.\nWe use the whole chicken, but here I'm using some drumsticks. Make sure you grab bone-in for whatever you use. Considering it goes from the grill back to the palm oil sauce, you will definitely dry out boneless chicken breasts.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-chicken-and-fufu-corn.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nFUFU CORN\nThe third part of my Camair plate. I love everything corn. Boiled fresh sweet corn. Charcoal roasted corn, koki corn; our Cameroonian corn pudding. Corn is definitely a staple in West African Cooking. Fufu corn is simply described as a dough made with ground dried corn. Like MASA if you're familiar with it but just corn, nothing else. Get your biceps ready because you'll be needing some muscle. My mother will make a pot big enough to feed 10 mouths. Thank goodness I have just three mouths to feed but its so worth it.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-chicken-with-turnip-greens.jpg?resize=695%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWith this trio on the plate, I feel at home. I may not have access to the African huckleberry but this Cameroonian Style Turnip greens and kati kati is as good as what I ate as a child.

Fill up a large bowl or kitchen sink with cold water and thoroughly rinse turnip greens. (About 2-3 times) Remove large, tough vein and slice greens. Then bring a large pot of water to boil. Add greens and cook for 7-10 minutes until just tender.\n2. Transfer into ice cold water. Once cool enough to touch, strain with colander and then use your hands to squeeze out as much water as you can. Set aside.\n3. Add sliced onions and diced tomatoes into a large skillet or fry pan. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally until tomatoes are reduced into a chunky sauce.. Then add in canola oil and fry for 3-5 minutes. Season to taste (or slightly over) with salt. Stir in greens and cook for another 4-5 minutes or until desired tenderness of greens. Adjust seasoning if necessary.\nkati kati\n1. Pad dry chicken thighs with a paper towel and transfer into a bowl. Add in all dried spices, maggi, salt and canola oil. Thoroughly rub chicken until completely coated. Let marinate for 15-20 minutes.\n2. Grill on all sides for about 3-4 minutes, ensuring you get a slight char.\n3. Blend tomatoes and onions with little to no water. In a medium sauce pan, heat palm until it just starts to smoke. Add in tomato paste and blended onions/tomatoes. Stir and cook for about 3-5 minutes. Season to taste. Add in grilled chicken with a cup of warm water. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes until chicken is thoroughly cooked and sauce reduced. Serve with greens.\nfufu corn\n1. Bring 2 and a half cups of water to a gentle simmer in a medium sauce pot. In a separate bowl, mix 2 cups of cornmeal with about 2 cups of room temp water. Carefully add into simmering water. Reduce heat to medium and use a strong wooden spoon to stir occasionally. Cook for about 7 minutes; it will thicken. Then add in 1/3 cup of warm water, cover and cook for another 5-7 minutes. Use dominant hand and mix thoroughly, breaking any chunks until smooth.\n2. Cut seran wrap or foil paper big enough to wrap fufu corn. Place on chopping board or flat surface. Set aside a bowl with warm water. Dip ladle in water (prevents sticking), then scoop dough or fufu unto seran wrap. Carefully raise edges into a bundle, twist 1-2 times and place on a plate twist side down. Repeat until all dough is used. Let cool for a few minutes to solidify.

This is then cooked, not just blanched because we want it a little softer and will need more than a couple minutes in boiling water. Transfer into an ice bath ( never did this with njama njama).\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blanched-Turnip-Greens.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nUse both hands to squeeze out excess water. At this point you are ready to sautee or freeze for future use. Kept it simple with some Onions, roma tomatoes and a little canola oil.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Turnip-greens-cooked.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTrust me, if your turnip greens were boring before, you've found your fix with this recipe. So simple , yet each bite makes you wonder how something so simple could taste so good. I still remember my mother cooking Njama Njama. We'll call it \"poor man njama njama\", with just palm oil, salt and pepper. Yet , our plates were wiped clean in record time. No \"eat your greens \" fight necessary, we loved it.\nKati Kati or Khati Khati\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kati-Kati-chicken.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-spicy-cameroon-chicken.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nAnother favorite. Fire grilled chicken, cooked in palm oil and tomato base sauce boasting some wonderful traditional flavors. I can't get enough of Kati kati. I've gone as far as making tacos with this chicken recipe. My corn tortillas become my fufu corn. That simple, we try it all with the same amazing taste.\nWe use the whole chicken, but here I'm using some drumsticks. Make sure you grab bone-in for whatever you use. Considering it goes from the grill back to the palm oil sauce, you will definitely dry out boneless chicken breasts.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-chicken-and-fufu-corn.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nFUFU CORN\nThe third part of my Camair plate. I love everything corn. Boiled fresh sweet corn. Charcoal roasted corn, koki corn; our Cameroonian corn pudding. Corn is definitely a staple in West African Cooking. Fufu corn is simply described as a dough made with ground dried corn. Like MASA if you're familiar with it but just corn, nothing else. Get your biceps ready because you'll be needing some muscle. My mother will make a pot big enough to feed 10 mouths. Thank goodness I have just three mouths to feed but its so worth it.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kati-kati-chicken-with-turnip-greens.jpg?resize=695%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWith this trio on the plate, I feel at home. I may not have access to the African huckleberry but this Cameroonian Style Turnip greens and kati kati is as good as what I ate as a child. Hope you get to cooking turnip greens a different way than you normally do; the Cameroonian way.\nWEST AFRICAN TURNIP GREENS AND KATI KATI\nIngredients\nTurnip Greens\n- 4 bunches fresh turnip greens\n- 4 roma style tomatoes diced ((About 2 cups))\n- 1/2 small onion sliced\n- 2 habanero peppers\n- salt to taste\nKati Kati Chicken\n- 6 chicken thighs bone in\n- 1 tsp onion powder\n- 1/2 tsp Garlic powder\n- 1/4 tsp white pepper\n- 1/4 tsp cameroonian pepper ((or hot c ayenne))\n- 1 maggi cube (or chicken bouillon)\n- 1/4 tsp Kosher salt\n- 1/2 Tbsp canola oil\n- 3 Tbsp palm oil\n- 1 Tbsp tomato paste\n- 3 roma tomatoes\n- 1/4 yellow onion\nfufu corn\n- 2 cups white/yellow corn meal\n- 5 cups of water\n- foil or seran wrap\nInstructions\nTurnip greens\n1. Fill up a large bowl or kitchen sink with cold water and thoroughly rinse turnip greens. (About 2-3 times) Remove large, tough vein and slice greens. Then bring a large pot of water to boil. Add greens and cook for 7-10 minutes until just tender.\n2. Transfer into ice cold water. Once cool enough to touch, strain with colander and then use your hands to squeeze out as much water as you can. Set aside.\n3. Add sliced onions and diced tomatoes into a large skillet or fry pan. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally until tomatoes are reduced into a chunky sauce.. Then add in canola oil and fry for 3-5 minutes. Season to taste (or slightly over) with salt. Stir in greens and cook for another 4-5 minutes or until desired tenderness of greens. Adjust seasoning if necessary.\nkati kati\n1. Pad dry chicken thighs with a paper towel and transfer into a bowl. Add in all dried spices, maggi, salt and canola oil. Thoroughly rub chicken until completely coated. Let marinate for 15-20 minutes.\n2. Grill on all sides for about 3-4 minutes, ensuring you get a slight char.\n3. Blend tomatoes and onions with little to no water. In a medium sauce pan, heat palm until it just starts to smoke. Add in tomato paste and blended onions/tomatoes. Stir and cook for about 3-5 minutes. Season to taste. Add in grilled chicken with a cup of warm water. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes until chicken is thoroughly cooked and sauce reduced. Serve with greens.\nfufu corn\n1. Bring 2 and a half cups of water to a gentle simmer in a medium sauce pot. In a separate bowl, mix 2 cups of cornmeal with about 2 cups of room temp water. Carefully add into simmering water. Reduce heat to medium and use a strong wooden spoon to stir occasionally. Cook for about 7 minutes; it will thicken. Then add in 1/3 cup of warm water, cover and cook for another 5-7 minutes. Use dominant hand and mix thoroughly, breaking any chunks until smooth.\n2. Cut seran wrap or foil paper big enough to wrap fufu corn. Place on chopping board or flat surface. Set aside a bowl with warm water. Dip ladle in water (prevents sticking), then scoop dough or fufu unto seran wrap. Carefully raise edges into a bundle, twist 1-2 times and place on a plate twist side down. Repeat until all dough is used. Let cool for a few minutes to solidify. Unwrap and serve with kati kati and turnip greens.", "content_info": {"domain": "daily_life", "subdomain": "Cooking Tips, food knowledge, food preservation"}}}}

First off, these ingredients are readily available, and you can enjoy this hearty one pot dish too.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Njangsang-sauce-with-mackerel.jpg?resize=1365%2C2048&ssl=1]\nWhat we love the most about this dish is the simplicity and minimal cleanup involved. Back then, my mother will prepare all the ingredients and then carefully wrap the fish in plantain leaves. She'll then place this on hot coal/ ashes. When it was all done, the steam and aroma, when she unwrapped the sometimes-charred plantain leaves lured us to the kitchen . Typically, we serve this with plantains, cocoyams , cassava or rice. It still is one of my favorite dishes she makes whenever she visits.\nINGREDIENTS FOR THE SAUCE\nLet's touch on some of the traditional spices we are using to make the sauce and where you can find them. Years ago, when I moved to the US, the easiest way to obtain these ingredients was to have someone bring it from Cameroon. That is definitely not the case today. These ingredients are now readily available, and you can get them with just a click, or a quick drive depending on where you live.\nPREPARING THE SPICE BLEND\nStart by toasting the njangsang, pebbe and white pepper in a pan. You can also soak the njangsang seeds in warm water to soften them before grinding. Then, transfer all ingredients into a blender, add some water and blend until smooth. Note not to add whole country onion into your blender. It is too hard and will damage your blades. Get an actual spice blender if you only have whole country onion.\nCOOKING THE KING MACKEREL STEAKS\nStart by seasoning your steaks with some salt. Then pour the spice blend over the fish, giving the sauce pot a gentle shake to completely cover the fish, then add some water and bring it to a simmer. If you have little ones at home who are not comfortable with the heat from the habanero, you can choose to add a whole habanero now (omit from spice blend). Remove when soft enough so it does not split open and spice up the entire sauce.\nCook for 20 minutes until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Finally, fry up some onions in a little bit of oil and pour into sauce pot. Gently shake the pot , simmer for another 3-5 minutes and you're done! You'll love this with some boiled green plantains, cocoyams, rice or whatever you'll like to pair it with. Sometimes we enjoy it with fried ripe plantains, so you can replace this pepper sauce with our king mackerel in njangsang sauce\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Njangsang-sauce-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nKING MACKEREL IN NJANGSANG SAUCE\nPrep Time: 5 minutes mins, Cook Time: 25 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 2 King mackerel steaks (( about 1 inch thick ~ 1 pound))\n- 1/8 cup Njangsang seeds\n- 1/2 tsp country onion ((or 1 whole country onion))\n- 1 small pebbe\n- 1/8 tsp white peppercorn\n- 1/2 small yellow onion ((1/2 to be blended, 1/2 sliced and fried with oil))\n- 2 sprigs of parsley\n- 2 large garlic cloves\n- 1/4 inch chunk of ginger\n- 1 medium Roma tomato\n- 1 habanero pepper\n- 1 maggi cube ((optional))\n- salt to taste\nInstructions\n1. Season Mackerel steaks with salt / maggi and place into saucepan.\n2. Toast njangsang seeds, white pepper, pebbe in a fry pan for about 3 minutes. Add into a blender together with 1/2 of the onion, tomato, parsley, ginger , garlic, onion and habanero pepper. Blend with 1 cup of water until smooth.\n3. Pour spice blend over fish. Add a pinch or two of salt. Rinse blender cup with 1/4 cup of water and pour into sauce pot.\n4. Cover and bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until fish can be easily flaked off the bone. Carefully shake or move fish around a few times while cooking to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season sauce to taste if necessary\n5. Then, heat about 1/4 cup of avocado oil (or canola oil /vegetable oil) and fry sliced onion until slightly brown. Pour entire content into sauce pot with fish and simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes and you're done.\n6. Serve with boiled ripe plantains, cocoyams, cassava or rice.\nNotes\nYou can use any fish for this recipe but a white fish works best. So Catfish, tilapia, flounder are a few other options. Using steaks instead of fillets will help keep your fish together while it cooks. I will not recommend using olive oil at the final step as this will slightly change the flavor profile.

With each bite i'll be regretting my decision to get a salad, regardless of my fitness goals. So main dish salads are definitely a dinner or brunch at home thing for us. We make it simple, quick and hearty.\nThis is very easy no fuss salad. Greens , mango, my favorite fruit and avocado dressed in lightly tangy honey ginger balsamic vinaigrette. Giving it a little more body with some pan grilled tilapia marinated with Essiespice Mango Chili Medley. In the absence of this spice you can substitute with any hot pepper you prefer, fresh or dry.

Thaw in the fridge the day before.\nThis comes together in under 30 minutes. The sweetness from the mango balances so well with the baby kale and spinach salad blend. Refreshing and light enough to carry you through lunch to an early dinner. Feel free to add in some couscous or quinoa for more substance.

If you have access to bitter leaf, you can try our traditional ndole recipe here . This recipe is for those without access to bitter leaf, or those who just want to try something different and new.\nKale and spinach are amazing cool season greens that are readily available at your local markets. Salads and smoothies are great but let us shift gears with these a little and bring in some nutty , savory notes with this ndole style kale and spinach.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ndole-with-fufu.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nINGREDIENTS FOR NDOLE STYLE KALE AND SPINACH\nKale and Spinach : The kale is blanched and then chopped while the spinach is added fresh. Both of these greens are rich in vitamins and nutrients.\nPeanuts : Raw, deshelled and peeled peanuts are essential for ndole. It gives ndole the creamy nutty flavor profile. You can also try other raw nuts, but you'll have to let us how that goes because peanut is the preferred nut. You can get raw peanuts at your local grocery store or online here\nAromatics and heat : Simply garlic, ginger, onions and a hot pepper. That's why we love ndole. Simple ingrdients.\nDried Fish and crayfish : the Umami that we love. This is pescatarian, so we are limiting our protein to dried seafood. You can source dried or dehydrated fish at local African stores or international markets.\nHOW TO MAKE NDOLE\nTraditional ndole with bitter leaf really is a labor of love but this right here comes together quickly.\nKale and spinach : Blanch kale for 2-3 minutes, drain and transfer into ice cold water to stop further cooking.

Set this aside alongside chopped spinach.\nDried fish : Precook your dried fish with 2 cups of water , sliced onions and some salt. Strain and reserve broth. Also debone fish and set aside.\nBoil peanuts for about 5 minutes and let cool. Combine with onion, garlic, ginger and a cup of water and blend until creamy. This is our ndole base. Cook with some of the broth from the dried fish into a creamy sauce into which our greens will be added.

Also use a good lid and expect some good splashing; so be careful when you open to stir.

Sometimes when I look through the ingredient list of peanut butter jars on the shelf I wonder why? How hard is it to make peanut butter? But then again, if you want it to last forever, somethings gotta give. Making peanut butter at home is super easy and you can play with so many different flavors.\nFor a start we are keeping it simple with some plain peanut butter with just a pinch or two of salt. With this recipe you can add more flavors like honey, maple syrup and more. Its homemade after all\nROASTING\nWe buy raw peanuts from an oriental store down in Nashville, but it can be purchased online too. Spanish peanuts are my favorite because its close to what we grow in Cameroon.\nNothing more than 350 degrees! Low and slow is best. Keeping the oven temp at 300 was just right for us . You want to roast until some of the skins start to peel and the peanuts get a little sheen on them. The oils are just starting to be released. Do not worry if your oven seems a little smoky when you do a quick check. Yes do a quick check and give the roasting pan a little shake.\nYou can also roast stove top in a pan. That way you have eyes on the peanuts. Takes a little longer but this is actually how we roasted peanuts for groundnut soup back then.\nPEELING THE PEANUTS\nI've done this for as long as I can remember. From the oven, let the peanuts cool. Then gather as much as you can between your palms and rub, applying a little pressure. Do this a few times. Take that tray outback or some place to discard the skin without making a big mess. Pretend you're a pro at flipping pancakes but in this case you blow while you toss the peanuts in the air. Not too high! The peels fly off. Or you can do a pour from container to container with a blowing fan somewhere ( too much work). You do not have to peel every single nut but enough to show you put a little effort into peeling.\nNO STIR HOMEMADE PEANUT BUTTER\nThis is just peanuts and salt. No water, no oil, NOTHING else. I use a food processor. You blend until it slowly turns from a think paste to lighter, spreadable consistency. At this point you can flavor and keep blending to mix.

There is always a bulb available in most kitchens. In probably more than half of the savory meals available here and everywhere online, the first step is to sauté onions. We love onions and I'm sure most of you do too. Here is a little to know about the most commonly used and available onions.\nSEASONALITY AND BUYING ONION\nOnions are pretty easy to grow. With its year-round availability, most home gardeners chose to reserve space for other things. It is also relatively affordable. When buying onions, ensure they are firm with no mushy or dark spots. They should have a smooth outer skin, no bruises and there should also be no visible sprouting.\nSTORING ONIONS\nStore onions in a cool, dark area. Exposing to light accelerates sprouting which could result in quick rotting. When stored well, onions can keep for months but we usually have to replenish about every two weeks or so. Once cut, tightly seal and keep in the refrigerator for up to three days.\nSo, let's look at these four readily available ones.\nTHE YELLOW ONION\nMost commonly available onion in grocery stores. If a recipe calls for onions without any specifications, this is what most people will use. So this is your \"all purpose\" go to. It has a yellow papery covering with a creamy white interior when you slice. Very strong and pungent flavor. They also have a high starch content, and it holds its own when caramelizing.\nTHE SWEET ONION\nAs the name indicates, these have a higher sugar content. It is a little flatter than the yellow and much milder in flavor. Its covering is lighter and almost opaque looking. We've noticed these don't tend to keep as well as the other onions, so use them up or store in the fridge. If you are looking to caramelize and yield that beautiful browning, here is your go to onion. Also, a perfect candidate for onion rings.\nRED ONIONS\nSome also call it \"purple\" onion. It has a beautiful bright reddish-purple skin with a purple and white flesh. Sharp, crisp with a little more kick than the yellow. You can soak in ice cold water for about 15 to 20 minutes to tone down that sharp bite. Best enjoyed raw in salads, sandwiches and more. Also, a great choice for grilling. When it comes to pickling, they are one of the popular ones to use. A spoonful or more of pickled red onions will add a beautiful touch of color and flavor to your favorite dishes.\nWHITE ONIONS\nIt has a thin papery skin with a white flesh. A little more tender and milder than the red and yellow. They are juicy, crunchy with a crisp bite; making them perfect as a finishing touch to bring out some fresh feel to a dish. Think Salsa, Pico de Gallo, guac and other salads.\nJust to drop in a little biology for perspective, there are about 900 species of onions, the largest plant genera in the world! Our hands will most likely reach out for these four. Surely, local farmers are growing different varieties to satisfy your quest for flavor.

Be patient, its worth the wait. The aroma alone is mouth watering. Served with some roasted plantains or miondo and a fresh pepper sauce on the side. Miondo is made from fermented yucca root.

Its versatile, bursting with flavor and the perfect base for Jollof, pasta sauces, stews and much more.\nWhat tomatoes to Use\nMost years, between my neighbor and I, there is a variety of heirloom tomatoes growing. With how plentiful the harvest is, we do not limit ourselves to a specific variety based on water content. When it comes to making this sauce, we use a medley of tomatoes as you can see. Growing a variety with fewer seeds and a meatier texture is ideal but don't ditch the cherry tomatoes just yet. The variety comes together wonderfully once roasted.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/garden-tomatoes.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/garden-tomatoes-sauce.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n***The Seeds***\nSeeds are not removed before roasting the tomatoes. You are welcome to but after roasting and blending, we notice there is no significant difference whether we removed the seeds or not.\nRoasting the tomatoes\nOn that beautiful Saturday we probably picked about 15 pounds of tomatoes. Start by giving them a thorough wash. Even though they are home grown and organic you still need to clean them up. Then we layer them on baking sheets that are deep enough to hold some of the tomato juices during roasting. We are also bringing in some sweet onions , garlic (Whole bulb unpeeled and wrapped in foil) and some black pepper. Feel free to add in some dried herbs. Think oregano, basil, thyme and more.\nDrizzle a generous amount of cooking oil that is appropriate for a 400°F convection oven. We are using avocado oil but you can use olive oil at a lower oven temp. Toss to coat tomatoes and onions, then roast for about 45 minutes or until you see some color on them.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tomato-sauce.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nMaking the Tomato Sauce\nLet everything cool for a few minutes before blending. Squeeze out garlic cloves from the bulb. Use a high power blender if you could so you get that smooth velvety texture. For a thicker sauce, leave most of the tomato juice caught at the bottom of the pan but use it up for a thinner sauce. ***At this point, you can make yourself a grilled cheese sandwich and enjoy with a seasoned ladle of the sauce***\nTaste and season the batch to your liking before storing.\nWays to use your oven roasted tomato sauce\nUse as a starting point for most tomato based recipes. It is rich in flavor and already cooked down to the perfect consistency. With the variety of tomatoes used, we have a slightly sweet sauce.\nJollof Rice : Use this sauce with some broth and other spices to cut down cooking time for your jollof rice. Enjoy this recipe using your oven roasted tomato sauce\nPasta Sauce : Bring in the basil and other aromatics and build up your perfect pasta sauce.\nPizza : Pizza night doesn't get any easier and tastier. Spread a hefty lable, add your favorite toppings, cheese, bake and enjoy.\nStews : Rice and stew is one of our favorites and this just makes the cook time a lot shorter. Make chicken or beef stew with this.\nStoring your tomato Sauce\nYou can store sauce in the refrigerator for up to one week in a mason jar or any airtight container. We have enough to last a while so we will be freezing them. It is important to freeze in amounts that you can thaw and use up in one meal. A cup or two max.

It really was a dish for the big boss back then but it should definitely be savored by all.\nPoulet DG\nTraditional we use the whole chicken for Poulet DG, but today I'll be using mainly boneless chicken thighs.

Here the semi-ripe plantain gives this dish the perfect sweetness and a nice texture with each bite. How long it takes plantains to be ripe enough for this dish will depend on temperature, storage conditions and other environmental factors. It takes about 2-3 days for green plantains to become appropriately ripe for this dish. There should be no dark spots on the skin (too ripe).

We got creative for sure but little squares are the way to go.\nChristmas in Cameroon\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/chin-chin-gift-.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1]\nAs a child , it is customary for us to visit as many neighbors as we can on Christmas day. As a matter of fact we did not open presents. Probably because we already had them on. NEW CLOTHES AND SHOES! That was our gift every year. Things are different in America for sure when it comes to the holidays and the concept of \"gift\".\nBy the end of the day, you best believe there were soup stains and what not on those brand new dresses. We ate something at every stop and chin chin was definitely an item on the menu.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pumpkin-spice-chin-chin.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nPumpkin Spice\nUsually chin chin is made with nutmeg. Once I discovered I did not have nutmeg the idea to use Pumpkin spice is the next best option. That being said you can definitely branch out and try new things. I actually added a little bit of cinnamon too. Add in whatever screams the holiday spirit for you.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/chin-chin-packets.jpg?resize=705%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCaption: CHIN CHIN\nMAKING CHIN CHIN\nSometimes I literally just throw in all my ingredients and mix.

Let cool and enjoy. Like I mentioned earlier, these are deliciously bad for you. But eh, there is only one Christmas a year so I'm sure your fitfam will cut you some slacks.\nWill be gifting my neighbors these this holiday season. You may not have time to mail out a batch to someone special but I hope you make some for yourself. Sometimes we do owe ourselves a guilty pleasure. This year, I am going for this delicious, crunchy pumpkin spice chin chin.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/chin-chin-gifts.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nCHRISTMAS CHIN CHIN\nThese pumpkin spice chin chin are addictive, crunchy and definitely a holiday tradition for us.\nPrep Time: 45 minutes mins, Cook Time: 20 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 3 cups all purpose flour\n- 1 7.6fl oz nestle media crema ((or 225ml of milk: whole, 2% , 1% or skim))\n- 2 and 1/2 Tablespoon unsalted butter ((softenned))\n- 1 medium egg\n- 3/4 cup of granulated sugar\n- 1/2 tsp baking powder\n- 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice\n- 1/2 tsp cinnamon\n- canola oil for frying\nInstructions\n1.

Warm, crispy bites with a pinch of salt enjoyed with your favorite dip or sauce. In Cameroon we enjoy it with a spicy pepper sauce . Simply delightful and you need just a few ingredients to make this.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tostones-recipe.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nINGREDIENTS FOR PLANTAIN TAPÉ TAPÉ\nGreen Plantains : They have to be green to be crispy, with a little give once you take a bite. Slightly ripe or ripe plantains will soak up too much oil during the second fry, making them greasy. When buying plantains, make sure they are strong and firm.\nSalt : This is all you'll need for seasoning. Add a sprinkle of some kosher salt before the second fry or right after frying.\nOil : These are deep fried, and you'll need to use oils with a high enough smoke point. Canola, soybean and avocado oil all have a smoke point over 400°F. We used canola oil.\nPREPARE THE PLANTAINS\nYou'll find green plantains a little more challenging to peel than ripe plantains. For tapé tapé, plantains are cut into about 1-inch slices before frying. Rather than peeling the entire plantain before cutting, cut before you peel. Thoroughly wash, trim ends and then cut. Then make cuts along ridges until you reach the thick flesh. Use your thumb or paring knife to lift and peel off the skin. You can soak in water to prevent the skin from darkening if you're not frying right away but make sure it is completely dry before frying.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/plantain.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cut-plantain.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nTO MAKE PLANTAIN TAPÉ TAPÉ\nOnce your plantains are peeled and cut, you'll start with the first fry. Oil should be at least 350°F. These are big cuts and you 'll fry for about 3 minutes. You want some color change and to partially cook enough to press right after frying. Use a tortilla press to smash the plantains. You can also use a mason jar, a plate, a flat wooden spoon, basically any food safe item that can smash plantains.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tostones-recipes.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nSprinkle a pinch of salt on both sides, return the smashed plantain back into the hot oil and fry again until golden brown and crispy. You can also salt right after the second fry. Remove and place on a paper towel to soak up any excess oil.\nHOW TO SERVE\nThis is a great side dish, appetizer or snack. You can simply enjoy as is but here are a few ways we like to enjoy them.\nSpicy Pepper Sauce : Some form of spicy sauce is always available at home and we use it as a dip with plantain tapé tapé. You can also serve with a mild sauce or your favorite dip.\nGuacamole : Pairing with guac will make a great appetizer for gatherings.\nSalsa : Bring in some tropical vibes. Use one to scoop up a hefty dose of mango salsa. Simply refreshing.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tostones.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWe prefer to enjoy immediately but if you do have some leftovers, it's best reheated in the oven or air fryer. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and reheat for about 5 minutes or until they are crispy, then serve.\nPlantain tapé tapé is simply delightful. You'll absolutely savor that first crispy bite but save some for others or at least make enough to share.

Right next to class was this tiny little hut, single handedly manned by the most amazing egg sandwich maker I knew at that time. There was always a line, and I can't even imagine how she got to serve all those hungry students before class. Now I wonder if she baked the bread in house but all I know is the moment my 150 CFA francs ( ~$0.25) was collected every morning, I was ready for a delicious warm baguette filled with the perfect omelet. Simply made with tomatoes and onions and seasoned to perfection.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Eggs.jpg?resize=1272%2C1272&ssl=1]\nI'll chow down that sandwich in little to no time and wish I could have more!

Right next to class was this tiny little hut, single handedly manned by the most amazing egg sandwich maker I knew at that time. There was always a line, and I can't even imagine how she got to serve all those hungry students before class. Now I wonder if she baked the bread in house but all I know is the moment my 150 CFA francs ( ~$0.25) was collected every morning, I was ready for a delicious warm baguette filled with the perfect omelet. Simply made with tomatoes and onions and seasoned to perfection.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Eggs.jpg?resize=1272%2C1272&ssl=1]\nI'll chow down that sandwich in little to no time and wish I could have more! That was it though, had to save my remaining cash for lunch.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Scrambled-eggs.jpg?resize=1280%2C1280&ssl=1]\nAnyways, like I said, this recipe is super simple and it really did brightened my morning. Freshly baked baguette is definitely a must , hence my early morning trip to our local bakery in town. Even better if you bake your own bread . Everything else should be in your kitchen.\nNot that coffee was on the menu back then but feel free to enjoy this one with a cup of joe or tea. Breakfast doesn't get any better than this. Believe me when I say you'll enjoy every hearty bite of this sandwich .\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Simple-Bread-and-egg-sandwich.jpg?resize=1654%2C1280&ssl=1]\nHope you get to try this sandwich. And if you're brainstorming on quick office breakfast ideas, I'm sure your colleagues will have lots to say about this baguette egg sandwich. Grab a few extra baguettes and impress the team. While at it, don't hold me responsible when they keep requesting you bring breakfast.\nSIMPLE BAGUETTE EGG SANDWICH\nPrep Time: 5 minutes mins, Cook Time: 10 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 1 foot long french baguette\n- 6 whole eggs\n- 1 roma tomatoes (diced)\n- 1/4 cup Yellow Onions (thinly sliced)\n- 1/4 cup chopped parsley\n- 1/2 Tbsp olive oil\n- salt to taste\nInstructions\n1.

The winter squash is making it to your local farmers markets or grocery stores this time of the year.

A touch of spice and a little bit of home from the Native All-Purpose Seasoning adds a smokiness that is just divine.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sploit-pea-soup-ingredients.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nThe fun part about winter soups are the veggie varieties you can add in.

Not only for your favorite sandwiches but seeds can also be sprouted for salads, stir fries, soups and more.\nWith a sprouting kit , you can have ready to eat sprouts year round. Your local farmers markets is also a good place to find many different varieties and their close relative; micro greens (which we will address another time).\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sprouts-at-home.jpg?resize=1096%2C1644&ssl=1]\nThe most readily available are Alfafa and bean sprouts , but as we previously mentioned, you can sprout and enjoy most seeds from the comfort of your home.\nHOW TO BUY\nSprouts tend to retain the flavors of the parent plant, so make sure it smells fresh and clean. Look for bright greens, different hues of yellow with no moldy spots. Check on that packaged date and beyond use date. When it comes to produce, be vigilant, get organic if you can and know your food source.\nGROW YOUR OWN SPROUTS\nEquipment\nTo make and enjoy your own at home, you will need a sprouting kit. We have been using this SOLIGHT growing kit and it works great for us. Any mason jar should work but the smooth, round nature of these jars give ample room for rotating the seeds once they start sprouting.\nThe size of your jars will determine how much you can sprout. There is no need to make a big batch because they grow fast and spoil fast too. Make what is enough to be consumed within 3 days.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SPROUTS.jpg?resize=1099%2C1648&ssl=1]\nBest seeds for sprouts\nAlfalfa seeds are one of the most popular seeds to sprout. They are a rich source of A, B, C, E and K Vitamins as wells as essential minerals like calcium and magnesium. Loaded with antioxidants and enzymes which could help support overall health and improve nutrient absorption.\nHow to make sprouts at home\nStart with clean, sanitized jars. Then soak seeds for 8-12 hours. Add enough water so seeds are completely submerged. Try not to soak for over 24 hours, as the seeds may start to rot. We are using water at room temperature. Close jars with mesh lids.\nAfter 12 hours, strain (through mesh lids, no need to open). Then thoroughly rinse seeds and strain. Place on stand in a dark area. Rinse, with high pressured water every 3-6 hours and strain (Twice a day at the least). Repeat this process until seeds sprout then place jar near an open window with good sunlight. Continue to rinse and strain for another 2-3 days until you see greens. Alfalfa takes us about 4-5 days total and bean sprouts about 5-7 days\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Sprouts.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nWhen rinsing, make sure you rotate jar and move things around. This ensures even sprouting of seeds.\nSTORING SPROUTS\nAs easy as they are to make, they sure do spoil quick. Consume within 3-5 days. Alfalfa spoils a lot quicker, so we enjoy them within a couple of days. Bean sprouts can last a little longer. Store in a zip lock bag in the crisper section of your refrigerator.\nMake a sandwich, salad or stir fry.

Part of me says I should feel guilty for pan frying, part of me says it's the best way to treat plantains this ripe. It is worth every bite!\nIn case you haven't noticed I love beans! Black, pinto , kidney , navy you name it. There is always a bag of dried beans of some sort ready to be boiled for future use. There are weekends where I dedicate a part of my day to cooking beans . Lets call it bean prep time. And no it's not time consuming at all, it's probably the least time consuming thing you can do, especially if you have a crock pot or pressure cooker.\nAll you do is wash, transfer into a crockpot or pressure cooker, add water, salt and cook on high for about 5 hours or 27 minutes if using a pressure cooker.

These are the words from my dear husband. After relocating almost a year ago from Wisconsin as apartment dwellers to Tennessee as homeowners, we finally have more kitchen cabinet space. Its funny how I did not recognize the extra minutes it takes to dig stuff out from jam packed cabinets until our kitchen pantry project was complete.\nHere comes my husband with boxes of mason jars from target. \"Here you go, organize our cabinets\". Lets just say I definitely ran with it. It is time consuming, depending on how much you have to work with; but it honestly is the best thing we've done to help keep our kitchen cabinets organized always.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kithcen-project-complete.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\n- We can easily locate what we're looking for\n- We know exactly the items we're running low of, so grocery lists are quick and easy\n- And NO MISHAPS! \"Chili powder\" for \"Cayenne\" . Everything is labelled.\nAnd yes, Cayenne was mistaken for chili powder.... and lets just say a pot of chili went bye bye. Speaking of labeling, we decided to label the caps and not the actual bottles. Reason being we can wash the jars and not worry about ruining the labels.\nSee that mess up there? That was me back then.....maybe you now, but its a simple fix. I couldn't wait for my jars to get out of the dishwasher so I would get things going. YES! WASH THEM FIRST!\nIt was a little overwhelming pulling everything out of the cabinet at once because I saw the disaster but I knew it is now or never. The night is young, Baylee is in bed, adult beverage around the corner, best playlist going, GAME ON! So I pulled everything out and got to work.\nWe all know you bought that brown rice because you decided to eat a little healthier (HIGH FIVE!) , or someone somewhere on social media (who doesn't matter by the way) made you feel guilty about eating white rice. Stay strong with that brown rice , but if its been there for years, \"LET IT GO\"! Get you a fresh batch and store in a mason jar. Make sure its the first grain you see in the morning, that way, you'll probably replenish that jar several times a year.\nBy the way I love brown rice! Lets make sure we store fresh ingredients so they stay that way even longer. If they go in stale, they come out stale (probably more stale)\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Kitchen-pantry-project.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nEnsuring everything is at eye level is challenging but storing easily identifiable ingredients at the top cabinet definitely helps. Its easy to differentiate beans (black , pinto lima, kidney...) from corn, rice or crayfish (please jar it up, no one wants their entire home smelling like crayfish!)\nOn the other hand, it probably will take a little longer to differentiate quinoa from millet, so here is where eye level , proper labelling comes in. Or you can get a step stool or label the front of your jars. Which ever works best.\nSince this project was completed, cooking is not only enjoyable but much more faster and easier. I love to cook and if you do, an organized kitchen is definitely a must.\nAnother kitchen project that sealed the deal for me was this kitchen cart from my dear husband.

Welcome to my rendition of meat and potatoes , my cheeseless casserole that will get everyone talking. Comfort food that warms your body and soul. My husband says he could literally eat it everyday. I guess we now have a go to meal when we have a bad day. A cold winter night dish that got its debut midsummer.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Snapseed.jpg?resize=1280%2C1280&ssl=1]\nWe're In the middle of a big move and I wanted something quick. When I say quick I mean under 30 minutes quick. Gave all my pots and pans a good cleaning and I wanted a one pan dish that will be ready in no time. With four days before our move , I'm trying to use up what I have and didn't plan for any grocery trip.\nPotatoes ? Check. Used some Yukon potatoes but you can also use russets. This is not a skin on recipe so get ready to peel and dice. Gimme lean veggie beef? Check. Gotta use them up before the move. This is probably my favorite meat substitute out there. You can find this at the health foods section ( refrigerated). They make amazing meatballs and in this case beef crumbles. Be ready for a sticky fingers when working with it but you'll be pleased at the end I promise. once you get them the right bite sizes, spray a cookie sheet, layer and bake for about 5 minutes. They firm up and you're done with the sticky mess.\nOnions? Check\nGarlic? Check\nTomatoes?.......TOMATOES???? No fresh tomatoes!!!! Not even a single one . That's just criminal . If you visit my kitchen, and there are no fresh tomatoes around then something's up. But hey, a peak in my kitchen cabinet revealed a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Even better.\nTomatoes ? Check.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_2839.jpg?resize=1198%2C1198&ssl=1]\nThose are the main ingredients you need for this dish. If you have some fresh thyme at home even better, but if not don't sweat it. Normally you'll find me adding things like pepper flakes , paprika , ginger and all that jazz but not with this one. I guess packing up all my spices helped tremendously in keeping things simple.\nSimple, delicious and hearty. Hope you get to enjoy a bowl of my vegan meat and potatoes casserole soon.\nVEGAN MEAT AND POTATOES CASSEROLE\nPrep Time: 10 minutes mins, Cook Time: 25 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 3 Cups diced (Yukon potatoes)\n- 1 Cup diced onions\n- 1 14oz can hunts fire roasted tomatoes\n- 1 Packet Lightlife gimmelean veggie beef\n- 3 Cloves Of garlic\n- 3 Sprigs Of thyme\n- 1 Cup water\n- Salt & pepper to taste\n- 2 Tbsp Basil Olive oil\nInstructions\n1. Preheat oven to 450. Cut veggie beef into bite size pieces. Layer on a greased cookie sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until they firm up.\n2. Heat oil in a medium cast iron skillet.

Welcome to my rendition of meat and potatoes , my cheeseless casserole that will get everyone talking. Comfort food that warms your body and soul. My husband says he could literally eat it everyday. I guess we now have a go to meal when we have a bad day. A cold winter night dish that got its debut midsummer.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Snapseed.jpg?resize=1280%2C1280&ssl=1]\nWe're In the middle of a big move and I wanted something quick. When I say quick I mean under 30 minutes quick. Gave all my pots and pans a good cleaning and I wanted a one pan dish that will be ready in no time. With four days before our move , I'm trying to use up what I have and didn't plan for any grocery trip.\nPotatoes ? Check. Used some Yukon potatoes but you can also use russets. This is not a skin on recipe so get ready to peel and dice. Gimme lean veggie beef? Check. Gotta use them up before the move. This is probably my favorite meat substitute out there. You can find this at the health foods section ( refrigerated). They make amazing meatballs and in this case beef crumbles. Be ready for a sticky fingers when working with it but you'll be pleased at the end I promise. once you get them the right bite sizes, spray a cookie sheet, layer and bake for about 5 minutes. They firm up and you're done with the sticky mess.\nOnions? Check\nGarlic? Check\nTomatoes?.......TOMATOES???? No fresh tomatoes!!!! Not even a single one . That's just criminal . If you visit my kitchen, and there are no fresh tomatoes around then something's up. But hey, a peak in my kitchen cabinet revealed a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Even better.\nTomatoes ? Check.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_2839.jpg?resize=1198%2C1198&ssl=1]\nThose are the main ingredients you need for this dish. If you have some fresh thyme at home even better, but if not don't sweat it. Normally you'll find me adding things like pepper flakes , paprika , ginger and all that jazz but not with this one. I guess packing up all my spices helped tremendously in keeping things simple.\nSimple, delicious and hearty. Hope you get to enjoy a bowl of my vegan meat and potatoes casserole soon.\nVEGAN MEAT AND POTATOES CASSEROLE\nPrep Time: 10 minutes mins, Cook Time: 25 minutes mins\nIngredients\n- 3 Cups diced (Yukon potatoes)\n- 1 Cup diced onions\n- 1 14oz can hunts fire roasted tomatoes\n- 1 Packet Lightlife gimmelean veggie beef\n- 3 Cloves Of garlic\n- 3 Sprigs Of thyme\n- 1 Cup water\n- Salt & pepper to taste\n- 2 Tbsp Basil Olive oil\nInstructions\n1.

Can't remember my mom adding curry to her Groundnut soup (peanut stew), but I'm trying my own version; and since I love curry with a passion, why not add it in.\nI must say, if you try tofu for the first time, the chances of you not liking it are pretty high.

Don't shy away from your spices, be super generous, it needs it.\nAnother very important step is drying the tofu. Put all the phone books you never open to use. If tofu is on your lunch or dinner menu, feel free to start drying first thing in the morning. I usually reserve at least an hour (you can get away with less). Slice tofu block down the middle, wrap in a kitchen towel and dry with some weights (Phone books!) over a chopping board or kitchen counter. This gets rid of the water and helps tofu cooks evenly and fast (crispy on the outside yet moist inside).\n[image: https://ourquickbytes.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/watermark635850130935018612.png?resize=830%2C768]\nDice tofu into ~ 1/2 inch cubes.

So let them cook properly, on medium heat , in a non stick pan with just enough olive oil (or canola oil / corn oil). When ready, set aside. They go in last after the peanut curry is ready.

Once November hits, time just goes by so fast and before we know it, the year is over and then comes the favorite month of the year, January (or is it?).\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/White-bean-and-turkey-soup-bowl.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nIt's going to be a cold January they say but does that really ever change? Even here in Tennessee we are looking at days with night temperatures in the low teens. Yikes! We need gloves, hats, protective hairstyles and most importantly hearty bowls of soup to warm our bodies.\nThis white bean ground turkey soup is winter love in a bowl. A flavor packed brothy soup with lots of herbs, vegetables and lean protein. We enjoy this even in the summer but the vibe sure is different in the winter. It is soup season after all.\nHere's all what you'll need to enjoy our bit of winter love in your home.\nWHITE BEAN GROUND TURKEY SOUP INGREDIENTS\nGround Turkey: A nice lean protein to give this more substance. We went with 93/7 but grab whatever is available. You can also substitute with ground chicken.\nWhite Bean: You can use navy or white kidney bean. We love to get dehydrated beans and cook it at home but you are welcomed to use canned beans. I must say, when you cook and salt your own to taste at home, you'll definitely enjoy it more.\nCarrots: Our favorite, root vegetable to add to soups. This nutritional powerhouse also brings in some color.\nAromatics: Soups will give you the opportunity to use up all those fresh herbs that you're afraid will go to waste. We mostly use herbs in small amounts, but they really are the MVPs here. Whether you have them fresh or dried, they'll do. Onions, garlic, celery, oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme. Feel free to throw in what you have. We grow a lot of mediterranean herbs in the backyard, so we are using what we dried from last summer's harvest for this soup.\nSpinach: Wilting a handful of spinach in soups is always a given. Just another show of color, the beautiful green. You can also use kale, Swiss chard or other mild flavor greens that cook quick.\nHalf and half (Optional) : Turkey is quite lean, so we wanted to bring in a little fat and richness. If you are dairy free, you can substitute with other dairy free options but be mindful because some will majorly change the flavor. However, if it works for you, go for it.\n[image: https://i0.wp.com/afrovitalityeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/White-bean-soup.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1]\nOnce you have your ingredients all set to go, everything just flows.

Even here in Tennessee we are looking at days with night temperatures in the low teens. Yikes! We need gloves, hats, protective hairstyles and most importantly hearty bowls of soup to warm our bodies.\nThis white bean ground turkey soup is winter love in a bowl.
